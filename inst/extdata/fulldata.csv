3031402,USA/Canada,Primary/Elementary,Literacy/English,"This report describes a cluster randomized control trial (RCT) intervention study of the effectiveness of the ABRACADABRA (ABRA) Web-based literacy system using a classroom-level RCT intervention with 1,067 children in 74 kindergarten and Grade 1 or Grade 1/2 classrooms across Canada. The authors closely followed the CONSORT criteria for executing and reporting high-quality RCT studies. Well-trained teachers delivered the ABRA intervention to their regular classrooms for 20 hr per child over one full semester. At posttest, the ABRA intervention classroom showed significant advantages over controls in phonological blending ability, letter-sound knowledge and, marginally, for phoneme segmentation fluency. A secondary analysis exploring the effects of different levels of program implementation showed that with fidelity of implementation (80% of intervention teachers), advantages were evident at posttests in phonological blending, phoneme segmentation fluency, sight word reading, and letter-sound knowledge. It is concluded that ABRA is an effective resource for key skills associated with early reading. Implications for the role of both Web-based technologies and extended professional development for technology in aiding in the scale-up of evidence-based reading interventions are discussed.

3030678,USA/Canada,Preschool/Kindergarten,Behaviour and Social Wellbeing,"Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the long-term effects of the Early Risers aoeSkills for Successa Conduct Problems Prevention Program (ER; August, Bloomquist, Realmuto, & Hektner, 2007), a multifaceted program targeting social, emotional, behavioral, and academic risk and protective factors to promote adaptive psychological development. Method: Based on the random assignment of their school, 245 kindergartners (mean age = 6.6 years, SD = 0.57; 68.6% male) with elevated teacher-rated aggressive behavior either participated in ER for 3 intensive years plus 2 booster years or served as controls. Participants were assessed annually during the intervention with teacher and parent reports and at 2 follow-up points. In the current study, 129 of the original participants were reassessed with diagnostic interviews in late high school (mean age = 16.3, SD = 0.52), and multiple imputation was used to deal appropriately with missing data. Results: Program participants had significantly fewer symptoms of conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and major depressive disorder than did controls. The programas effect on increasing social skills and parent discipline effectiveness by Grade 3 mediated these effects. Conclusions: The results of this study provide further evidence of the long-term positive effects of multicomponent, elementary-age, targeted conduct problems prevention programs. Training children in social skills and parents in effective discipline are possible mechanisms to divert maladaptive developmental cascades.

3031910,USA/Canada,Preschool/Kindergarten,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have demonstrated the short-term efficacy of pharmacotherapy and behavior therapy for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) , but no longer-term (i.e., >4 months) investigations have compared these 2 treatments or their combination. METHODS: A group of 579 children with ADHD Combined Type, aged 7 to 9.9 years, were assigned to 14 months of medication management (titration followed by monthly visits); intensive behavioral treatment (parent, school, and child components, with therapist involvement gradually reduced over time); the two combined; or standard community care (treatments by community providers). Outcomes were assessed in multiple domains before and during treatment and at treatment end point (with the combined treatment and medication management groups continuing medication at all assessment points). Data were analyzed through intent-to-treat random-effects regression procedures. RESULTS: All 4 groups showed sizable reductions in symptoms over time, with significant differences among them in degrees of change. For most ADHD symptoms, children in the combined treatment and medication management groups showed significantly greater improvement than those given intensive behavioral treatment and community care. Combined and medication management treatments did not differ significantly on any direct comparisons, but in several instances (oppositional/aggressive symptoms, internalizing symptoms, teacher-rated social skills, parent-child relations, and reading achievement) combined treatment proved superior to intensive behavioral treatment and/or community care while medication management did not. Study medication strategies were superior to community care treatments, despite the fact that two thirds of community-treated subjects received medication during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: For ADHD symptoms, our carefully crafted medication management was superior to behavioral treatment and to routine community care that included medication. Our combined treatment did not yield significantly greater benefits than medication management for core ADHD symptoms, but may have provided modest advantages for non-ADHD symptom and positive functioning outcomes.",A 14-month randomized clinical trial of treatment strategies for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

8154183,Africa,Primary/Elementary,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"Design The study’s design was a cluster-randomized,
matched-pairs, parallel trial of a behavior-based sexual assault
prevention intervention in the informal settlements.
Methods The participants were primary school girls aged 10–
16. Classroom-based interventions for girls and boys were
delivered by instructors from the same settlements, at the same
time, over six 2-h sessions. The girls’ program had components
of empowerment, gender relations, and self-defense.
The boys’ program promotes healthy gender norms. The control
armof the study received a health and hygiene curriculum.
The primary outcome was the rate of sexual assault in the prior
12 months at the cluster level (school level). Secondary outcomes
included the generalized self-efficacy scale, the distribution
of number of times victims were sexually assaulted in
the prior period, skills used, disclosure rates, and distribution
of perpetrators. Difference-in-differences estimates are reported
with bootstrapped confidence intervals.
Results Fourteen schools with 3147 girls from the intervention
group and 14 schools with 2539 girls from the control
group were included in the analysis. We estimate a 3.7 %
decrease, p = 0.03 and 95 % CI = (0.4, 8.0), in risk of sexual
assault in the intervention group due to the intervention (initially
7.3 % at baseline). We estimate an increase in mean
generalized self-efficacy score of 0.19 (baseline average 3.1,
on a 1–4 scale), p = 0.0004 and 95 % CI = (0.08, 0.39).
Interpretation This innovative intervention that combined

3031872,UK/Ireland,Middle/High School,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"Background: Depression in adolescents is a significant problem that impairs everyday functioning and increases the risk of severe mental health disorders in adulthood. Although this is a major problem, relatively few adolescents with, or at risk of developing, depression are identified and referred for treatment. This suggests the need to investigate alternative approaches whereby preventative interventions are made widely available in schools. Objective: To investigate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of classroom-based cognitive- behavioural therapy (CBT) in reducing symptoms of depression in high-risk adolescents. Design: Cluster randomised controlled trial. Year groups (n = 28) randomly allocated on a 1: 1: 1 basis to one of three trial arms once all schools were recruited and balanced for number of classes, number of students, Personal, Social and Health Education (PSHE) lesson frequency, and scheduling of PSHE. Setting: Year groups 8 to 11 (ages 12-16 years) in mixed-sex secondary schools in the UK. Data were collected between 2009 and 2011. Participants: Young people who attended PSHE at participating schools were eligible (n = 5503). Of the 5030 who agreed to participate, 1064 (21.2%) were classified as 'high risk': 392 in the classroom-based CBT arm, 374 in the attention control PSHE arm and 298 in the usual PSHE arm. Primary outcome data on the high-risk group at 12 months were available for classroom-based CBT (n = 296), attention control PSHE (n = 308) and usual PSHE (n = 242). Interventions: The Resourceful Adolescent Programme (RAP) is a focused CBT-based intervention adapted for the UK (RAP-UK) and delivered by two facilitators external to the school. Control groups were usual PSHE (usual school curriculum delivered by teachers) and attention control (usual school PSHE with additional support from two facilitators). Interventions were delivered universally to whole classes. Primary outcomes: Clinical effectiveness: symptoms of depression [Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ)] in adolescents at high risk of depression 12 months from baseline. Cost-effectiveness: incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) based on SMFQ score and quality-adjusted life-years (from European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions scores) between baseline and 12 months. Process evaluation: reach, attrition and qualitative feedback from service recipients and providers. Results: SMFQ scores had decreased for high-risk adolescents in all trial arms at 12 months, but there was no difference between arms [classroom-based CBT vs. usual PSHE adjusted difference in means 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.34 to 2.28; classroom-based CBT vs. attention control PSHE -0.63, 95% CI -1.99 to 0.73]. Costs of interventions per child were estimated at 41.96 for classroom-based CBT and 34.45 for attention control PSHE. Fieller's method was used to obtain a parametric estimate of the 95% CI for the ICERs and construct the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve, confirming that classroom-based CBT was not cost-effective relative to the controls. Reach of classroom-based CBT was good and attrition was low (median 80% attending > 60% of sessions), but feedback indicated some difficulties with acceptability and sustainability. Conclusions: Classroom-based CBT, attention control PSHE and usual PSHE produced similar outcomes. Classroom-based CBT may result in increased self-awareness and reporting of depressive symptoms. Classroom-based CBT was not shown to be cost-effective. While schools are a convenient way of reaching a wide range of young people, implementing classroom-based CBT within schools is challenging, particularly with regard to fitting programmes into a busy timetable, the lack of value placed on PSHE, and difficulties engaging with teachers and young people. Wider use of classroom-based depression prevention programmes should not be undertaken without further research. If universal preventative approaches are to be pursued, their clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness with younger children (aged 10-11 years), before the incidence of depression increases, should be investigated. Alternatively, the clinical effectiveness of indicated school-based programmes targeting those already displaying symptoms of depression should be investigated.

3031624,UK/Ireland,Primary/Elementary,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness of a programme of asthma clubs in improving quality of life in primary school children with asthma. METHODS: A cluster randomised intervention trial was undertaken in 22 primary schools within the urban area of south and east Belfast, Northern Ireland. Schools were randomised in pairs to immediate or delayed groups. The study subjects comprised 173 children aged 7-11 years whose parents had notified the school of their asthma diagnosis. Children attended school based weekly clubs over an 8 week period. The main outcome measures were the interview administered Paediatric Quality of Life Questionnaire scores, ranging from 1 (worst) to 7 (best), spirometry, and inhaler technique. RESULTS: Over 15 weeks, small but non-significant improvements in the overall quality of life score (mean 0.20; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.20 to 0.61) and in each of its three components, activity limitation (0.20; -0.43 to 0.84), symptoms (0.23; -0.23 to 0.70), and emotional function (0.17; -0.18 to 0.52), were observed in the immediate compared with the delayed group. Inhaler technique at week 16 was markedly better in the immediate group, with 56% having correct technique compared with 15% in the delayed group. No significant effect of the intervention on spirometry results could be demonstrated.

METHODS: Thirty-two primary schools in the northwest of England participated. After a baseline assessment of plaque and the completion of a dental knowledge questionnaire by the children, the schools were allocated randomly to active or control groups. Children in schools allocated to the active group received the dental health program, which consisted of four one-hour lessons. After four months the children were examined clinically and scored for plaque, and a second questionnaire was administered. The schools in the control group were then allocated randomly to receive the program or not over the following three months, the program being withdrawn from the schools who initially received it. A further assessment of plaque was made and a questionnaire administered seven months after the baseline of the study. RESULTS: The active groups had 20 percent and 17 percent lower mean plaque scores than the control group at four and seven months (P < .001). The children's knowledge of which type of toothbrush should be used and the role of disclosing tablets improved in the initial test group when compared with the control group and this was retained over the second part of the study.

To determine (1) the effectiveness among pre-adolescents in The Bahamas of a PMT-based HIV prevention program 'Focus on Youth in the Caribbean' (FOYC) and (2) the role of the targeted PMT constructs in intervention effect. 1,360 sixth grade youth (10-11 years of age) from 15 urban schools in New Providence, The Bahamas were randomized by school to receive either FOYC or a control condition. Data collected at baseline, 6 and 12 months post intervention were analyzed. A five-step scheme was used to assess sexual behavior progression, ranging from '1' = 'a virgin without intention to have sex' to '5' = 'having sex without a condom'. Group-based trajectory analysis was utilized in assessing the program effect. Two sexual behavior progression patterns were detected: slow progressors and quick progressors. Receiving FOYC reduced the likelihood for adolescents to become quick progressors (adjusted OR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.64-1.00). The observed effectiveness was especially impacted by a subset of the targeted PMT constructs. FOYC effectively delays sexual risk among Bahamian pre-adolescents.

This study compared the effect of manualized School Psychiatric Consultation (SPC), CAPSLE (a systems and mentalization focused whole school intervention), and treatment-as-usual (TAU) in reducing aggression and victimization among elementary school children. Method: Participants were 1,345 third to fifth graders in nine elementary schools in a medium-sized Midwestern city who took part in a cluster-level randomized controlled trial with stratified restricted allocation, to assess efficacy after two years of active intervention and effectiveness after one year of minimal input maintenance intervention. Outcome measures included peer and self-reports of bullying, bystanding, and mentalizing behavior and classroom behavioral observations of disruptive and off-task behavior. Results: CAPSLE moderated the developmental trend of increasing peer-reported victimization (p less than 0.01), aggression (p less than 0.05), self-reported aggression (p less than 0.05) and aggressive bystanding (p less than 0.05), compared to TAU schools. CAPSLE also moderated a decline in empathy and an increase in the percent of children victimized compared to SPC (p less than 0.01) and TAU conditions (p less than 0.01). Results for self-reported victimization, helpful bystanding, and beliefs in the legitimacy of aggression did not suggest significantly different changes among the study conditions over time. CAPSLE produced a significant decrease in off-task (p less than 0.001) and disruptive classroom behaviors (p less than 0.01), while behavioral change was not observed in SPC and TAU schools. Superiority with respect to TAU for victimization (p less than 0.05), aggression (p less than 0.01), and helpful (p less than 0.05) and aggressive bystanding (p less than 0.01) were maintained in the follow-up year.

However, PA levels within PE lessons are often low. In this cluster-randomized controlled trial, we examined the effects of three self-determination theory-based motivational strategies on PA and sedentary behavior, as well as their hypothesized antecedents during PE lessons. Methods: Data were collected in Sydney, Australia (October-December 2011). After baseline testing, teachers (n = 16) and their classes (n = 288 students; M = 13.6. years, 50.4% male) were randomly assigned to one of four teaching strategy conditions: (1) explaining relevance; (2) providing choice; (3) complete free choice; or (4) usual practice. Teachers then delivered the assigned strategy. Primary outcomes were accelerometer-assessed PA and student motivation during lessons. Secondary outcomes included sedentary behavior, perceptions of teachers' support and psychological needs satisfaction. Results: The 'free choice' intervention increased PA (p< .05). 'Providing choice' and 'free choice' interventions decreased sedentary behavior (p< .05). The interventions did not influence motivation, but students' autonomy increased during both choice-based interventions (p< .05). Conclusions: Promoting choice can produce short-term increases in PA and decreases in sedentary behavior, as well as increased perceived autonomy during PE lessons. 2013 Elsevier Inc.",A cluster randomized controlled trial of strategies to increase adolescents' physical activity and motivation in physical education: Results of the Motivating Active Learning in Physical Education (MALP) trial,https://www.google.com/search?q=A+cluster+randomized+controlled+trial+of+strategies+to+increase+adolescents'+physical+activity+and+motivation+in+physical+education:+Results+of+the+Motivating+Active+Learning+in+Physical+Education+(MALP)+trial,2013,Universal,Regular Teachers/Lecturers,Between Half and Full Term,Behaviour and Social Wellbeing,None,Clustered,288,16,Yes,Whole Sample Only,Immediate Post-Test Only,Yes,"Yes, But Not Reported","Yes, Theoretical Perspectives",Yes,Australia/New Zealand Middle/High School Physical Health and Wellbeing

The aim of this work is to determine the effectiveness of the BtBYCB program on (i) pupils' well-being, self-perceptions, self-esteem, aspirations, and learning strategies; and (ii) changes in modifiable health-risk behaviors (i.e., physical activity, diet, smoking, and alcohol consumption). A two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial employing a wait-list control plus qualitative and mixed-method evaluations was used. Participants were school pupils from Years 7 and 8 (aged 11-13 years). Ten schools located in southwest England were randomly allocated to receive the BtBYCB intervention (n = 5 schools; 711 pupils) or a control condition (i.e., usual Personal, Social, and Health Education classes) (n = 5 schools; 622 pupils). Participants in the intervention condition received a program consisting of (i) a talk from an Olympian/Paralympian; (ii) 11 one-hour teacher-led PSHE classroom sessions in which pupils identified their aspirations, values, and interests and explored and acted on these via activities such as personal development planning, goal-setting, and peer-mentoring; and (iii) participated in a celebration event (e.g., second visit from Olympian/Paralympian and short individual presentations). Data were collected at baseline, post-intervention, and at 3-month follow-up.Focus groups (pupils and teachers) and individual interviews (headteachers) were conducted in the 5 intervention schools to (i) gain an in-depth understanding of mechanisms of change; (ii) explore ways in which the participants' motivation and engagement could be enhanced, and (iii) elicit user-feedback pertaining to how the program, content, and appeal could be improved.A mixed-method approach was used to describe and explain the differing experiences of particular groupings within and across the intervention schools; i.e., those for whom the program was effective, those that experienced little, if any change, and those for whom the program led to an inverse effect.

children's social–emotional competence (assessed via the Social Skills Improvement System

Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ); Goodman, 1997). Forty-five schools in Greater Manchester,
England, were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. Allocation was balanced
by proportions of children eligible for free school meals and speaking English as an additional
language via minimization. Children (N = 4516) aged 7–9 years at baseline in the participating
schools were the target cohort. During the two-year trial period, teachers of this cohort in
schools allocated to the intervention group delivered the PATHS curriculum, while their
counterparts in the control group continued their usual provision. Teachers in PATHS schools
received initial training and on-going support and assistance from trained coaches. Hierarchical
linear modeling of outcome data was undertaken to identify both primary (e.g., for all children)
and secondary (e.g., for children classified as “at-risk”) intervention effects. A primary effect of
the PATHS curriculum was found, demonstrating increases in teacher ratings of changes in
children's social–emotional competence. Additionally, secondary effects of PATHS were identified,
showing reductions in teacher ratings of emotional symptoms and increases in pro-social
behavior and child ratings of engagement among children identified as at-risk at baseline.
However, our analyses also identified primary effects favoring the usual provision group,
showing reductions in teacher ratings of peer problems and emotional symptoms, and secondary
effects demonstrating reductions in teacher ratings of conduct problems and child ratings
of co-operation among at-risk children. Effect sizes were small in all cases. These mixed findings
suggest that social and emotional learning interventions such as PATHS may not be as

METHODS: A total of 2,678 pupils with a mean age of 12.1 years attending 28 schools participated in a school-based dental health education program. The study used a cluster randomized controlled study design. The health service administrators stipulated that all participants receive the intervention; to meet this requirement, a rolling program of two six-month periods was utilized. During the first six months, half the adolescents received the intervention program, the other half acting as controls. Throughout a further six-month period, all participants received the intervention program. This research design allowed comparisons between participants receiving the program for six and 12 months. At baseline, six, and 12 months, a random subsample of 40 children in each participating school had their plaque scores recorded and a questionnaire was used to record their knowledge of dental health and reported dental behavior. RESULTS: The analysis used the subjects clustered within the schools, which were the units of randomization. The intervention program produced statistically significant improvements (P < .001) in knowledge about periodontal disease and the frequency of sugar intake and dental caries in both assessment time periods. The reported frequency of brushing did not change, but the group who had received 12 months of the intervention were more likely (P < .05) to brush for over a minute. At six months the early intervention group had a statistically significant, 13 percent reduction in the mean proportion of sites with plaque compared with the late intervention group (P = .043). This difference was sustained at 12 months (P = .037).

3030792,USA/Canada,Middle/High School,Other School Subjects,"BACKGROUND: Concerns about adverse consequences of early childbearing and risk of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) have renewed interest in the sexual behaviour of adolescents in developing countries, where they represent a large proportion of the population and are at highest risk. To date, little is known about the sexual knowledge of adolescents in developing countries. This study's primary objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of a responsible sexuality education programme (RSP) in changing knowledge associated with sex and sexuality; secondary objectives were to evaluate changes in attitudes and behavioural intent. METHODS: A cluster randomized design randomizing high school classes in Belize City. Subjects were 13-19 years old. RESULTS: Seven schools in Belize City were selected; 8 classrooms were randomized to the intervention arm and 11 classrooms to the control arm (N = 399). The intervention was associated with two more correct answers on the post-test (difference score was 2.22 points, 95% CI = 0.53, 3.91) after adjusting for gender and previous sexual experience. After controlling for gender and previous sexual experience, the intervention was associated with no change in the attitudes (0.06, 95% CI: -2.89, 2.82) or behavioural intent domains (0.84, 95% CI: -1.12, 2.46). CONCLUSIONS: Greater changes in knowledge were observed in the intervention group than in the control group following the intervention. Changes were not observed for the attitude or behavioural intent domains. These results and the results of similar studies may be used to further improve sex education programmes as it is imperative that students have access to the information necessary to make informed decisions regarding their sexual health.","A cluster randomized trial of a sex education programme in Belize, Central America","https://www.google.com/search?q=A+cluster+randomized+trial+of+a+sex+education+programme+in+Belize,+Central+America",2003,Universal,Regular Teachers/Lecturers,Single Session,None,None,Clustered,399,19,No,Some Sub-Groups Reported,Immediate Post-Test Only,No,No,"Yes, Theoretical Perspectives",No,USA/Canada Middle/High School Other School Subjects
3031330,Rest of Europe,Primary/Elementary,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"Over-exposure to sunlight increases the risk of skin cancers, particularly when exposure occurs during childhood. School teachers can play an active role in providing an education programme that can help prevent this. 'Living with the Sun,' (LWS) is a sun safety education program for school children based on a handy guide for classroom activities designed to improve children's knowledge, but moreover to positively modify their sun safety attitudes and behaviours. The goal of our study was to determine the effectiveness of this programme by examining children's knowledge, attitude and sun exposure behaviours prior to and after the completion of the programme. We carried out a cluster randomised trial in which the classes were randomly assigned to one of two groups; one using the LWS programme and another that didn't, serving as the control. Data was collected before completion of the programme and an additional three times in the year after completion. The 70 participating classes (1,365 schoolchildren) were distributed throughout France. Statistical analysis confirmed that knowledge of sun risk increased significantly in the LWS classes (p < 0.001). Both groups positively changed their attitudes when considering the best sun protection, but the LWS group proved to consistently be more convinced (p = 0.04). After the summer holidays, differences between the two groups decreased throughout the year but stayed globally significant. We also observed some significant behaviour modification during the holidays. For instance, the LWS group applied sunscreen more frequently than the control group, and were more likely to wear a hat (72% versus 59%) and use a sun umbrella on the beach (75% versus 64%).",A cluster randomized trial to evaluate a health education programme 'Living with Sun at School',https://www.google.com/search?q=A+cluster+randomized+trial+to+evaluate+a+health+education+programme+'Living+with+Sun+at+School',2012,Universal,Regular Teachers/Lecturers,Between Half and Full Term,None,None,Clustered,1365,70,Yes,Whole Sample Only,Immediate Post-Test Only,No,No,"Yes, Descriptive Theory of Change",Yes,Rest of Europe Primary/Elementary Physical Health and Wellbeing

3030794,USA/Canada,Middle/High School,Behaviour and Social Wellbeing,"Objectives: The aim of this cluster randomized trial was to evaluate the effectiveness of a school-based theatre intervention program for immigrant and refugee youth in special classes for improving mental health and academic outcomes. The primary hypothesis was that students in the theatre intervention group would report a greater reduction in impairment from symptoms compared to students in the control and tutoring groups. Methods: Special classrooms in five multiethnic high schools were randomly assigned to theater intervention (n = 10), tutoring (n = 10) or control status (n = 9), for a total of 477 participants. Students and teachers were non-blinded to group assignment. The primary outcome was impairment from emotional and behavioural symptoms assessed by the Impact Supplement of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) completed by the adolescents. The secondary outcomes were the SDQ global scores (teacher and youth reports), impairment assessed by teachers and school performance. The effect of the interventions was assessed through linear mixed effect models which incorporate the correlation between students in the same class, due to the nature of the randomization of the interventions by classroom. Results: The theatre intervention was not associated with a greater reduction in self-reported impairment and symptoms in youth placed in special class because of learning, emotional and behavioural difficulties than a tutoring intervention or a non-active control group. The estimates of the different models show a non-significant decrease in both self-reported and impairment scores in the theatre intervention group for the overall group, but the impairment score decreased significantly for first generation adolescents while it increased for second generation adolescents. Conclusion: The difference between the population of immigrant and refugee youth newcomers studied previously and the sample of this trial may explain some of the differences in the observed impact of the theatre intervention.

Due to this there is growing pressure on schools to address the emotional well-being and mental health of needs of their students, as well as their traditional academic learning. Though a number of interventions have been conducted with the intention to address the promotion of mental health in schools, mental health literacy, or the stigma and discrimination of mental illness, an inconsistency of reporting standards and methodologies have led many systematic reviews to claim that more rigorous research is needed (e.g. Wells et al., 2003; Spence and Shortt, 2007). The SchoolSpace intervention project involved schools from Birmingham, UK, taking part in a randomised controlled trial which aimed to build upon criticisms and lessons learnt from previous systematic reviews. Mental health professionals worked alongside young people with personal experience living with mental illness to provide workshop days for young adolescents. These workshops aimed to reduce mental illness and promote resilience, as well as to tackle the discrimination of mental illness which can cause barriers to help-seeking (Schomerus, Matschinger, Angermeyer, 2009).

DESIGN: A random sample of fifty-four English primary schools was randomised to receive the 10-month intervention Project Tomato, a multi-component theory-based intervention, or the control. Each group consisted of twenty-seven schools. SETTING: Children's intake of fruit and vegetables is below recommendations. The English School Fruit and Vegetable Scheme has a short-term impact on intake while children are eligible for the scheme. SUBJECTS: Dietary measurements were collected from 658 Year 2 pupils aged 7-8 years at baseline and at follow-up 20 months later. RESULTS: Following an intention to treat analysis, the intervention as delivered compared with the control had no impact on the intake of fruit and vegetables (2 g/d, 95 % CI -23, 26 g/d) or on the number of portions of fruit (0.0 portions, 95 % CI - 0.3, 0.3) or vegetables (0.0 portions, 95 % CI - 0.2, 0.3) consumed daily by children. Intake of fruit and vegetables at school and home dropped by ? 100 g/d and 50 g/d, respectively, between baseline and follow-up in both the intervention and control groups.

Students in the experimental group were exposed to a brief cognitive strategy instruction for 10 days, which was designed to encourage development and application of effective planning for mathematical computation, whereas the comparison group received-standard math instruction. Standardized tests of cognitive processes and math achievement were given at pretest. All students completed math worksheets throughout the experimental phase. Standardized achievement tests (Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Achievement, Third Edition, Math Fluency and Wechsler Individualized Achievement Test, Second Edition, Numerical Operations) were administered pre- and postintervention, and Math Fluency was also administered at 1 year follow-up. Large pre-post effect sizes were found for students in the experimental group but not the comparison group on math worksheets (0.85 and 0.26), Math Fluency (1.17 and 0.09), and Numerical Operations (0.40 and -0.14, respectively). At 1 year follow-up, the experimental group continued to outperform the comparison group. These findings suggest that students with ADHD evidenced greater improvement in math worksheets, far transfer to standardized tests of math (which measured the skill of generalizing learned strategies to other similar tasks), and continued advantage 1 year later when provided the PASS-based cognitive strategy instruction.

3031949,NA,NA,NA,"The study was conducted to determine differences in course scores and in attitude change scores concerning public assistance between two groups of students taking a college course in social welfare problems. The experimental subjects took the course by programmed instruction in an independent study format while the control group was in a traditional classroom arrangement. Instructional variables were controlled to assume that both groups were treated the same. Results of achievement test scores showed no difference between groups regardless of teaching methods as determined with the t-test. Upper division students of both groups did better than freshman regardless of instructional methods. An attitude scale which had been previously validated was administered pre- and post-test to all subjects of both groups. The scale measured attitudes towards welfare programs and those adults who receive assistance. The students of both groups showed about the same positive gains in attitude scores (11.9 and 11.34 points, respectively) regardless of teaching method. Achievement test scores and attitude change scores varied greatly among individuals of both groups. The Pearson-r demonstrated that there was no significant correlation between course grades and attitude scores taken before or after by subjects of either group. A total of eighteen social work majors and forty-five students from other fields were in the study. The social work majors had significantly higher attitude scores on pre-test than other students. But their scores evened out in the post-test phase. Analyses of variance were conducted to determine the interactive effects of teaching method, college major, class standing and test scores of subjects by group. It was determined that class standing the only variable with significant effect on achievement, and there were no measurable interactive effects on attitude scores. Results derived from averaged test scores from both groups confirmed the findings of previous trials in which programmed instruction compared favorably with traditional means of college teaching. Programmed instruction students have scored the same or slightly better than those employing regular classroom instructional methods according to most findings. It was important to replicate previous studies, since there is no research reported in the literature comparing programmed instruction against conventional course methods in the social work and social welfare fields. The results of the attitude change scores were surprising. It would appear that the control group who met with the instructor and other class members would have more positive post-test attitude scores than the experimental subjects who worked alone in a self-study format. Prior research on social value sets among social work students at the baccalaureate and graduate levels indicated that there was very little change as a result of the university experience. However, previous attempts to study value change in college students may not have been specific enough to detect social attitudes and their alteration as a result of specific instructional interventions. Some of the value scaling instruments in the social work field appear to have measured cognitive and skill areas rather than values. The results of the study clearly indicate that values held by individual students are affected by instruction. The most likely explanation for the change was found in cognitive dissonance theory since the informational content was apparently the variable that effected the change.

However, evidence that it can improve knowledge and skills in health research, particularly in resource-poor settings, is limited. We compared the impact and acceptability of teaching two distinct content areas, Biostatistics and Research Ethics, through either on-line distance learning format or traditional on-site training, in a randomized study in India. Our objective was to determine whether on-line courses in Biostatistics and Research Ethics could achieve similar improvements in knowledge, as traditional on-site, classroom-based courses. METHODS: Subjects: Volunteer Indian scientists were randomly assigned to one of two arms.Intervention: Students in Arm 1 attended a 3.5-day on-site course in Biostatistics and completed a 3.5-week on-line course in Research Ethics. Students in Arm 2 attended a 3.5-week on-line course in Biostatistics and 3.5-day on-site course in Research Ethics. For the two course formats, learning objectives, course contents and knowledge tests were identical.Main Outcome Measures: Improvement in knowledge immediately and 3-months after course completion, compared to baseline. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar in both arms (n = 29 each). Median knowledge score for Biostatistics increased from a baseline of 49% to 64% (p < 0.001) 3 months after the on-site course, and from 48% to 63% (p = 0.009) after the on-line course. For the on-site Research Ethics course, median score increased from 69% to 83% (p = 0.005), and for the on-line Research Ethics course from 62% to 80% (p < 0.001).

MEASUREMENTS: Change in knowledge, alcohol use, alcohol-related harms and alcohol expectancies. FINDINGS: A computerized prevention program was more effective than usual classes in increasing alcohol-related knowledge of facts that would inform safer drinking choices and decreasing the positive social expectations which students believed alcohol may afford. For females it was effective in decreasing average alcohol consumption, alcohol-related harms and the frequency of drinking to excess (more than four standard drinks; 10 g ethanol).

Results indicated that students receiving the HELPS Program scored significantly better than students in the control group across several measures of early reading, with effect sizes ranging from medium to large. No other statistically significant differences were found. Implications of these findings are discussed in terms of increasing the use of evidence-based reading practices in schools.

DESIGN: Prospective randomised controlled intervention study of a sample of children drawn from a population survey of coronary risk factors in children. SETTING: Odense, Denmark. SUBJECTS: 69 children with mean blood pressure greater than or equal to 95th centile (hypertensive group) and 68 with mean blood pressure less than 95th centile (normotensive group), randomly selected from a population of 1369 children. INTERVENTION: 67 children were randomised to receive three extra lessons a week of an ordinary school physical education programme for eight months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Physical fitness assessed by calculation of maximum oxygen uptake and blood pressure recorded by one unblinded observer. RESULTS: After three months neither blood pressure nor physical fitness had changed significantly. After adjustment for values in weight, height, heart rate, and the variable in question before training physical fitness rose significantly at the end of eight months' training, by 3.7 mlO2/kg/min (95% confidence interval 2.2 to 5.3) in the normotensive training subgroup and by 2.1 mlO2/kg/min (0.1 to 4.2) in the hypertensive training subgroup compared with that in the controls. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures in the training subgroups fell significantly by 6.5 mm Hg (3.2 to 9.9) and 4.1 mm Hg (1.7 to 6.6) respectively in the normotensive group and by 4.9 mm Hg (0.7 to 9.2) and 3.8 mm Hg (0.9 to 6.6) respectively in the hypertensive group.

3031275,Australia/New Zealand,Middle/High School,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"BACKGROUND: This study evaluates the benefits of a self-directed Internet intervention for depression (MoodGYM) delivered as a part of the high school curriculum. METHOD: One hundred and fifty-seven girls, aged 15 and 16 years, were allocated to undertake either MoodGYM or their usual curriculum. MoodGYM's impact on depressive symptoms, risk of depression, attributional style, depression literacy and attitudes toward depression was examined using random effect regression. RESULTS: MoodGYM produced a significantly faster rate of decline in depressive symptoms over the trial period than the control condition. The effect size for MoodGYM was not significant immediately after the intervention (Cohen's d=.19, 95% CI -.18-.56) but was moderate and significant 20 weeks after the intervention (d=.46, 95% CI .10-.82). Girls with high depression scores before intervention showed the strongest benefits on self-reported depression at follow-up (d=.92, 95% CI .10-1.38). There were no significant intervention effects on depression status, attributional style, depression literacy, and attitudes. Approximately 70% of girls in the MoodGYM group completed less than three of its modules and completion of fewer modules was related to high depression score before intervention.

STUDY DESIGN: During two 10-week school terms, 800 11-year-olds took part in a randomized controlled trial with the standard physical activity and nutrition program in six schools, the standard program in a further seven schools but with the addition of physical activity enrichment for higher risk children in those schools, and no program in five control schools. Cluster analysis identifying the 29% or so highest risk children used systolic blood pressure, percent body fat, physical fitness, and blood cholesterol. RESULTS: Fitness improved significantly in program schools, particularly with enrichment in higher risk boys. Substantial improvements persisted 6 months later in girls from program schools. At 'Enrichment' schools, cholesterol showed significant benefits in higher risk girls and, 6 months later, in both boys and higher risk girls. Sodium intake and, in girls, subscapular skinfolds were lower in 'Enrichment' schools when the program ended, but not 6 months later. CONCLUSION: Two-semester health programs with physical activity enrichment for higher risk children can produce benefits sustained for at least 6 months.

Purposes: The purpose of this study was to compare the teaching quality of full-time (FT) faculty with that of part-time (PT) faculty in one Chinese medical school. Methods: In 3 consecutive years, 881 3rd year medical students were enrolled and randomly distributed into two groups, being taught by either a FT faculty member or a PT faculty member.

This study evaluated the effectiveness of a family-school intervention, Family-School Success (FSS), designed to improve the family and educational functioning of students in Grades 2-6 who meet criteria for ADHD combined and inattentive types. Key components of FSS were conjoint behavioral consultation, daily report cards, and behavioral homework interventions. Method: FSS was provided over 12 weekly sessions, which included 6 group sessions, 4 individualized family sessions, and 2 school-based consultations. Participating families were given the choice of placing their children on medication; 43% of children were on medication at the time of random assignment. Children (n = 199) were randomly assigned to FSS or a comparison group controlling for non-specific treatment effects (Coping With ADHD Through Relationships and Education CARE]). Outcomes were assessed at post-intervention and 3-month follow-up. The analyses controlled for child medication status. Results: FSS had a significant effect on the quality of the family-school relationship, homework performance, and parenting behavior. Conclusions: The superiority of FSS was demonstrated even though about 40% of the participants in FSS and CARE were on an optimal dose of medication and there were significant time effects on each measure.

The authors first evaluated the program in 2006-8 using a randomized controlled trial design. The evaluation tested the logic model that was hypothesized to underpin the program and evaluated the program's impact on the following outcomes: reading comprehension, enjoyment of learning, self esteem, locus of control and aspirations for the future. The evidence from this first randomized controlled trial (RCT) indicated that 'Time to Read' had a positive effect in terms of increasing the children's future aspirations (effect size = +0.17) but was unable to find evidence that the program had any effect in relation to the three remaining outcomes identified through the logic model (the children's general levels of self-esteem, enjoyment of education and reading skills). The report concluded that the logic model did not adequately capture the effects that the program may be having. It highlighted recent literature which suggested that more specific outcomes may have been more appropriate than the global outcomes that were originally identified i.e. enjoyment of reading instead of enjoyment of learning and self esteem related specifically to reading rather than global self esteem. The aim of this follow-up study was to rigorously evaluate the impact of the 'Time to Read' mentoring program on the following literacy outcomes: decoding, reading rate, reading accuracy, fluency and reading comprehension; and non literacy outcomes: enjoyment of reading, reading confidence and aspirations for the future. The research was conducted in 50 primary schools from across Northern Ireland. This follow-up trial has found clear evidence that the refined 'Time to Read' program is effective in improving reading outcomes for children, particularly in relation to the foundational reading skills of decoding, reading rate and reading fluency.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a collaboratively designed school-based intervention for reducing children's symptoms of PTSD and depression that has resulted from exposure to violence. DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial conducted during the 2001-2002 academic year. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Sixth-grade students at 2 large middle schools in Los Angeles who reported exposure to violence and had clinical levels of symptoms of PTSD. INTERVENTION: Students were randomly assigned to a 10-session standardized cognitive-behavioral therapy (the Cognitive-Behavioral Intervention for Trauma in Schools) early intervention group (n = 61) or to a wait-list delayed intervention comparison group (n = 65) conducted by trained school mental health clinicians. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Students were assessed before the intervention and 3 months after the intervention on measures assessing child-reported symptoms of PTSD (Child PTSD Symptom Scale; range, 0-51 points) and depression (Child Depression Inventory; range, 0-52 points), parent-reported psychosocial dysfunction (Pediatric Symptom Checklist; range, 0-70 points), and teacher-reported classroom problems using the Teacher-Child Rating Scale (acting out, shyness/anxiousness, and learning problems; range of subscales, 6-30 points). RESULTS: Compared with the wait-list delayed intervention group (no intervention), after 3 months of intervention students who were randomly assigned to the early intervention group had significantly lower scores on symptoms of PTSD (8.9 vs 15.5, adjusted mean difference, - 7.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], - 10.8 to - 3.2), depression (9.4 vs 12.7, adjusted mean difference, - 3.4; 95% CI, - 6.5 to - 0.4), and psychosocial dysfunction (12.5 vs 16.5, adjusted mean difference, - 6.4; 95% CI, -10.4 to -2.3). Adjusted mean differences between the 2 groups at 3 months did not show significant differences for teacher-reported classroom problems in acting out (-1.0; 95% CI, -2.5 to 0.5), shyness/anxiousness (0.1; 95% CI, -1.5 to 1.7), and learning (-1.1, 95% CI, -2.9 to 0.8). At 6 months, after both groups had received the intervention, the differences between the 2 groups were not significantly different for symptoms of PTSD and depression; showed similar ratings for psychosocial function; and teachers did not report significant differences in classroom behaviors.

3030781,Australia/New Zealand,Primary/Elementary,Literacy/English,"This dissertation describes the methods and findings of a mixed-methods multi-level randomized evaluation study of the impact of the New Heights Reading Program on the fluency and comprehension of struggling readers. The impact analysis is a randomized complete block experiment (Meter, Kutner, Nachtsheim, & Wasserman, 1996) that uses a combination of individual and group randomization (Boruch, May, Lavenberg, et al., 2004; Raudenbush, 1997). A complementary process evaluation provides context for the quantitative outcomes, helping to explain the varying degrees of implementation of the program and the corresponding outcomes for participating students (Scheirer, 1994). Originally developed in New Zealand under the name Rainbow Reading, this is the first evaluation of the American version of the curriculum. The study sample consists of 233 students in 30 third grade classrooms and 29 fifth grade classrooms in nine schools across two school districts. All students reading nine or more moths below grade level in the participating classrooms were randomly assigned to the treatment or control groups with a maximum of six students assigned to the treatment group per class. Students completed three pre- and post-test standardized measures of fluency and comprehension. Program providers participated in pre- and post-intervention teacher interviews, completed implementation surveys, and allowed the researcher to observe an average of eight sessions each during the eighteen weeks of intervention. Data from the process evaluation revealed that although the majority of teachers implemented the program with high quality, the quantity with which they used the program was quite low, as was their overall fidelity of implementation to the intended design. A rubric was developed to categorize the implementation practices of teachers across five dimensions: quality of practice, frequency of practice, quality of teacher conferences, frequency of teacher conferences, and goodness of fit. The impact evaluation found no significant impacts of the program on student fluency, comprehension, or attitudes as measured by the adjusted post-test differences between treatment and control groups. Furthermore, there were no detectable differences in impact of the New Heights Reading Program across the implementation levels of providers.

3030735,USA/Canada,College/University,Professional Training,"PURPOSE: To investigate the impact of an adjuvant Web-based teaching program on medical students' learning during clinical rotations. METHOD: From April 2003 to May 2004, 351 students completing clinical rotations in surgery-urology at four U.S. medical schools were invited to volunteer for the study. Web-based teaching cases were developed covering four core urologic topics. Students were block randomized to receive Web-based teaching on two of the four topics. Before and after a designated duration at each institution (ranging one to three weeks), students completed a validated 28-item Web-based test (Cronbach's alpha = .76) covering all four topics. The test was also administered to a subset of students at one school at the conclusion of their third-year to measure long-term learning. RESULTS: Eighty-one percent of all eligible students (286/351) volunteered to participate in the study, 73% of whom (210/286) completed the Web-based program. Compared to controls, Web-based teaching significantly increased test scores in the four topics at each medical school (p < .001, mixed analysis of variance), corresponding to a Cohen's d effect size of 1.52 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.23-1.80). Learning efficiency was increased three-fold by Web-based teaching (Cohen's d effect size 1.16; 95% CI 1.13-1.19). Students who were tested a median of 4.8 months later demonstrated significantly higher scores for Web-based teaching compared to non-Web-based teaching (p = .007, paired t-test).

3031075,USA/Canada,Primary/Elementary,Numeracy/Maths,"In an effort to identify instructional methods that might improve mathematics learning at the grade 4 level when used in a variety of educational settings under typical conditions, the REL Mid-Atlantic research team looked for promising, replicable practices that were being used broadly by teachers in U.S. schools, for which research showed promising results but had not been conducted using methodologies that can establish causal relationships. CompassLearning's OdysseyR] Math product met all of these criteria. Odyssey Math is a computer-based math curriculum developed by CompassLearning, Inc., to improve math learning for K-12 students. The software consists of a web-accessed series of learning activities, assessments, and math tools. These components constitute the basic framework of the software. CompassLearning professional development trainers presented the learning activities, math tools, and assessments as available options to intervention teachers during the summer professional development session. This study was the first randomized controlled trial to assess the impact of Odyssey Math on student achievement. The study had the statistical power needed to detect a 0.20 effect size and was well designed in that comparable groups were created at baseline and maintained through posttesting. Implementation during the school year was documented and shown to be consistent with typical implementation of the Odyssey Math software. The results from the multilevel model with pretest covariates also indicate that Odyssey Math did not yield a statistically significant impact on end-of-year student achievement. This study generated a statistically unbiased estimate of the effect of Odyssey Math on student achievement when implemented in typical school settings with typical teacher and student use. However, the findings apply only to participating schools, teachers, and students because the study used a volunteer sample.

DESIGN: A cluster randomized controlled trial and an observational analysis. SETTING: England, the UK. Intervention: funding to establish a school-based breakfast club vs. control (no funding). MAIN RESULTS: Intention to treat analysis showed improved concentration (Trail Making Test Part A) amongst the intervention group at 3 months. Fewer pupils within the intervention group reported having skipped classes within the last month and fewer pupils within the intervention group reported having skipped 1 or more days of school within the last month at 1 year. Observational analysis at 1 year showed a higher proportion of primary-aged breakfast club attendees reported eating fruit for breakfast in comparison to non-attendees. A higher proportion of breakfast club attendees had borderline or abnormal conduct and total difficulties scores (primary-aged pupils) and prosocial score (secondary-aged pupils). CONCLUSIONS: Analyses revealed a mixed picture of benefit and apparent disbenefit. This study illustrated the challenges of evaluating a complex intervention in which the evaluators had less control than is usual in randomized trials over recruitment, eligibility checking and implementation. If the impact of new policy initiatives is to be assessed using the most robust forms of evaluation, social policy needs to be organized so that evaluations can be constructed as experiments.

3031520,Rest of Europe,College/University,Professional Training,"Objective During laparoscopic surgery distractions often occur and multitasking between surgery and other tasks, such as technical equipment handling, is a necessary competence. In psychological research, reduction of adverse effects of distraction is demonstrated when specifically multitasking is trained. The aim of this study was to examine whether multitasking and more specifically task-switching can be trained in a virtual-reality (VR) laparoscopic skills simulator. Design After randomization, the control group trained separately with an insufflator simulation module and a laparoscopic skills exercise module on a VR simulator. In the intervention group, insufflator module and VR skills exercises were combined to develop a new integrated training in which multitasking was a required competence. At random moments, problems with the insufflator appeared and forced the trainee to multitask. During several repetitions of a different multitask VR skills exercise as posttest, performance parameters (laparoscopy time, insufflator time, and errors) were measured and compared between both the groups as well with a pretest exercise to establish the learning effect. A face-validity questionnaire was filled afterward. Setting University Medical Centre Utrecht, The Netherlands. Participants Medical and PhD students (n = 42) from University Medical Centre Utrecht, without previous experience in laparoscopic simulation, were randomly assigned to either intervention (n = 21) or control group (n = 21). Results All participants performed better in the posttest exercises without distraction of the insufflator compared with the exercises in which multitasking was necessary to solve the insufflator problems. After training, the intervention group was significantly quicker in solving the insufflator problems (mean = 1.60 Log(s) vs 1.70 Log(s), p = 0.02). No significant differences between both the groups were seen in laparoscopy time and errors. Conclusion Multitasking has negative effects on the laparoscopic performance. This study suggests an additional learning effect of training multitasking in VR laparoscopy simulation, because the trainees are able to handle a secondary task (solving insufflator problems) quicker.

3031316,UK/Ireland,Primary/Elementary,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"BACKGROUND: Improving nutrition knowledge among children may help them to make healthier food choices. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness and acceptability of a novel educational intervention to increase nutrition knowledge among primary school children. METHODS: We developed a card game 'Top Grub' and a 'healthy eating' curriculum for use in primary schools. Thirty-eight state primary schools comprising 2519 children in years 5 and 6 (aged 9-11 years) were recruited in a pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial. The main outcome measures were change in nutrition knowledge scores, attitudes to healthy eating and acceptability of the intervention by children and teachers. RESULTS: Twelve intervention and 13 control schools (comprising 1133 children) completed the trial. The main reason for non-completion was time pressure of the school curriculum. Mean total nutrition knowledge score increased by 1.1 in intervention (baseline to follow-up: 28.3 to 29.2) and 0.3 in control schools (27.3 to 27.6). Total nutrition knowledge score at follow-up, adjusted for baseline score, deprivation, and school size, was higher in intervention than in control schools (mean difference = 1.1; 95% CI: 0.05 to 2.16; p = 0.042). At follow-up, more children in the intervention schools said they 'are currently eating a healthy diet' (39.6%) or 'would try to eat a healthy diet' (35.7%) than in control schools (34.4% and 31.7% respectively; chi-square test p < 0.001). Most children (75.5%) enjoyed playing the game and teachers considered it a useful resource. CONCLUSIONS: The 'Top Grub' card game facilitated the enjoyable delivery of nutrition education in a sample of UK primary school age children.

3031588,Rest of Europe,Preschool/Kindergarten,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"Background: Previous studies on physical activity interventions in preschools have reported limited effectiveness. Participatory community-based approaches hold promise for increasing intervention effectiveness and involving parents as key stakeholders in a sustainable way. Purpose: To assess whether a participatory parent-focused approach using parents as agents of behavioral change enhances the efficacy of a preschool physical activity (PA) intervention. Design: Two-armed, cluster-RCT with preschool as unit of randomization and children as unit of analysis. Setting/participants: 39 South German preschools applying for an existing state-sponsored PA program with 826 children (52% boys, aged 5.0 &plusmn; 0.2 years), with 441 allocated to the intervention arm. Intervention: Control preschools received a state-sponsored program consisting of twice-weekly gym classes over 6 months. In intervention preschools, this program was augmented by motivating parents to develop and implement their own project ideas for promoting childrenï¿½s PA. Main outcome measures: Primary outcomes included mean accelerometry counts and time spent in moderate-to vigorous-intensity PA or sedentary behavior. Secondary outcomes were BMI, percentage body fat, quality of life, sleep quality, and general health. Outcomes were measured at baseline and at 6 and 12 months in both study arms (time period: 2008ï¿½2010). Using an intention-to-treat-analysis, linear multilevel regression models assessed change over time and across study arms, adjusted for age, gender, season, and preschool location. Analysis was conducted in 2011. Results: In 15 intervention preschools, parents implemented 25 PA projects. Compared with controls, intervention arm children were 11 minutes less sedentary per day (95% CI = 5.39, 17.01, p = 0.014); had significantly more mean accelerometry counts (1.4 counts/15 seconds [95% CI = 0.22, 2.54], p = 0.019); and showed benefits in perceived general health and quality of life. All other outcomes showed no difference between study arms. Conclusions: A participatory preschool intervention focusing on parents as agents of behavioral change may be able to promote PA and reduce sedentary behavior in preschoolers. These benefits may go beyond the effects of existing nonparticipatory interventions.

A 4-month group-randomized controlled trial was conducted in 67 adolescents from South-East Spain, 2007. Three classes were randomly allocated into control group (CG), experimental group 1 (EG1) and experimental group 2 (EG2). CG received usual PE (two sessions/week), EG1 received four PE sessions/week and EG2 received four PE sessions/week of high intensity. Cognitive performance (non-verbal and verbal ability, abstract reasoning, spatial ability, verbal reasoning and numerical ability) was assessed by the Spanish Overall and Factorial Intelligence Test, and academic achievement by school grades. All the cognitive performance variables, except verbal reasoning, increased more in EG2 than in CG (all P<0.05). Average school grades (e.g., mathematics) increased more in EG2 than in CG. Overall, EG2 improved more than EG1, without differences between EG1 and CG. Increased PE can benefit cognitive performance and academic achievement. This study contributes to the current knowledge by suggesting that the intensity of PE sessions might play a role in the positive effect of physical activity on cognition and academic success.

Computers offer a way of increasing access to care. Computerized therapy is effective for depressed adults but to date little has been done for depressed adolescents. Aims: The objective of this study was to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and effects of The Journey, a computerized cognitive behavioural therapy (cCBT) program for depressed adolescents. Method: Thirty-four adolescents (mean age 15.2 years, SD = 1.5) referred by school counsellors were randomly assigned to either cCBT or a computer-administered attention placebo program with psychoeducational content (CPE). Participants completed the intervention at school. Data were collected at baseline, post-intervention and at a 1-month follow-up. The primary outcome measure was the Child Depression Rating Scale Revised (CDRS-R); secondary outcome measures were: RADS-2; Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory; Adolescent Coping Scale (short form); response and remission rates on CDRS-R. Completion rates and self-reported satisfaction ratings were used to assess feasibility and acceptabililty of the intervention. Results: Ninety-four percent of cCBT and 82% of CPE participants completed the intervention. Eighty-nine percent liked The Journey a lot or thought it was ï¿½okayï¿½ and 89% of them would recommend it for use with others as is or after some improvement. Adolescents treated with cCBT showed greater symptom improvement on CDRS-R than those treated with CPE program (mean change on cCBT = 17.6, CI = 14.13ï¿½21.00; CPE = 6.06, CI = 2.01ï¿½10.02; p< .001).

Methods: A three arm pilot feasibility cRCT to assess the feasibility of a future definitive cRCT of brief alcohol intervention (ASBI) in a school setting with an integrated qualitative component (randomisation at school level). Feasibility of trial processes, recruitment and retention and a qualitative evaluation examined facilitators and barriers to the use of ASBI approaches in the school setting in this age group. Interventions: Young people aged 14-15 (Year 10) in 7 schools in the North East of England who screened positive on a single alcohol screening question and consented to take part were randomised to either provision of an advice leaflet (control condition, n=2 schools); a 30-minute brief interactive session which combined structured advice and motivational interviewing techniques delivered by the school learning mentor (Intervention 1, n=2 schools); a 60-minute session involving family members delivered by the school learning mentor (Intervention 2, n=3 schools). Young people were followed-up at 12-months. Objectives: To assess the feasibility and acceptability of a future definitive cRCT of ASBI in a school setting.

3031505,USA/Canada,College/University,Professional Training,"PURPOSE: To determine whether a longitudinal residents-as-teachers curriculum improves generalist residents' teaching skills. METHOD: From May 2001 to February 2002, 23 second-year generalist residents in four residencies affiliated with the University of California, Irvine, College of Medicine, completed a randomized, controlled trial of a longitudinal residents-as-teachers program. Thirteen intervention residents underwent a 13-hour curriculum during one-hour noon conferences twice monthly for six months, practicing teaching skills and receiving checklist-guided feedback. In a 3.5-hour, eight-station objective structured teaching examination (OSTE) enacted and rated by 15 senior medical students before and after the curriculum, two trained, blinded raters independently assessed each station with detailed, case-specific rating scales (rating scale reliability = 0.96, inter-rater reliability = 0.78). RESULTS: The intervention and control groups were similar in academic performance, specialty distribution, and gender (chi(2) = 0.434, p =.81). On a five-point Likert scale (5 = best teaching skills), intervention and control residents showed similar mean pretest OSTE scores (2.83 vs. 2.88, p =.736). The intervention group improved their mean overall OSTE scores 22.3% (more than two standard deviations) from 2.83 (pretest) to 3.46 (post-test; p <.0005; 95% CI 0.53 to 0.72). Intervention residents also improved significantly on six of eight OSTE stations. Within the control group, no pretest-to-post-test change achieved statistical significance. Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests confirmed these results. CONCLUSIONS: Generalist residents randomly assigned to receive a 13-hour longitudinal residents-as-teachers curriculum consistently showed improved OSTE scores.

Students in the intervention group had their personal learning goals assessed and matched with their general practice preceptors, and the students were set a task that developed their contact with other health resources in the community. Results from an evaluation questionnaire completed by the students at the end of their terms showed that the students in the intervention group rated their general practice preceptors more highly, had more contact with allied health and community organizations, felt that they had met their own learning goals to a greater extent, and enjoyed their term more. Student examination results showed that the students in the intervention group did not perform as well in one of the four areas of their end of term examination as did the students in the standard attachment.

3031038,USA/Canada,College/University,Professional Training,"BACKGROUND: Effective teaching requires an understanding of both what (content knowledge) and how (process knowledge) to teach. While previous studies involving medical students have compared preceptors with greater or lesser content knowledge, it is unclear whether process expertise can compensate for deficient content expertise. Therefore, the objective of our study was to compare the effect of preceptors with process expertise to those with content expertise on medical students' learning outcomes in a structured small group environment. METHODS: One hundred and fifty-one first year medical students were randomized to 11 groups for the small group component of the Cardiovascular-Respiratory course at the University of Calgary. Each group was then block randomized to one of three streams for the entire course: tutoring exclusively by physicians with content expertise (n = 5), tutoring exclusively by physicians with process expertise (n = 3), and tutoring by content experts for 11 sessions and process experts for 10 sessions (n = 3). After each of the 21 small group sessions, students evaluated their preceptors' teaching with a standardized instrument. Students' knowledge acquisition was assessed by an end-of-course multiple choice (EOC-MCQ) examination. RESULTS: Students rated the process experts significantly higher on each of the instrument's 15 items, including the overall rating. Students' mean score (ï¿½SD) on the EOC-MCQ exam was 76.1% (8.1) for groups taught by content experts, 78.2% (7.8) for the combination group and 79.5% (9.2) for process expert groups (p = 0.11). By linear regression student performance was higher if they had been taught by process experts (regression coefficient 2.7 [0.1, 5.4], p < .05), but not content experts (p = .09).

METHOD: A single class of the University of Utah School of Medicine was randomized into three study groups for the second-year parasitology course. The computer group (n = 29) used a locally developed interactive parasitology computer program; the lecture group (n = 32) had traditional lectures, and the combined group (n = 33) used both the computer program and lectures. Students' knowledge was assessed using a pretest, a final examination, and a posttest administered four months after the course. Students also used logs to track the amounts of time they spent studying. Their impressions and course evaluations were collected using a standardized course-evaluation form. RESULTS: The groups' scores on the pretest, final examination, and posttest were not statistically significantly different. Students in the computer group averaged 26.8 hours of studying over the two-week course compared with 32.1 hours in the lecture group and 32.7 hours in the combined group. The difference in study times between the computer and combined groups yielded a significant p value of 0.036. Students were generally positive about the course and the computer program.

8154337,Asia,Middle/High School,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"Rationale and objectives: Despite a recent proliferation of interventions to improve health, education, and
livelihoods for girls in low and middle income countries, psychosocial wellbeing has been neglected. This
oversight is particularly problematic as attending to psychosocial development may be important not
only for psychosocial but also physical wellbeing. This study examines the physical health effects of Girls
First, a combined psychosocial (Girls First Resilience Curriculum [RC]) and adolescent physical health
(Girls First Health Curriculum [HC]) intervention (RC þ HC) versus its individual components (i.e., RC, HC)
and a control group. We expected Girls First to improve physical health versus HC and controls.
Methods: Over 3000 girls in 76 government middle schools in rural Bihar, India participated. Interventions
were delivered through in-school peer-support groups, facilitated by pairs of local women.
Girls were assessed before and after program participation on two primary outcomes (health knowledge
and gender equality attitudes) and nine secondary outcomes (clean water behaviors, hand washing,
menstrual hygiene, health communication, ability to get to a doctor when needed, substance use,
nutrition, safety, vitality and functioning). Analyses included Difference-in-Difference Ordinary Least-
Squares Regressions and F-tests for equality among conditions.
Results: Girls First significantly improved both primary and eight secondary outcomes (all except
nutrition) versus controls. Additionally, Girls First demonstrated significantly greater effects, improving
both primary and six secondary outcomes (clean water behaviors, hand washing, health communication,
ability to get to a doctor, nutrition, safety) versus HC.
Conclusions: This study is among the first to assess the impact of a combined psychosocial and
adolescent health program on physical health.We found that combining these curricula amplified effects
achieved by either curriculum alone. These findings suggest that psychosocial wellbeing should receive
much broader attention, not only from those interested in improving psychosocial outcomes but also
from those interested in improving physical health outcomes.","A psychosocial resilience curriculum provides the “missing piece” to

The aim of the present study was to examine the efficacy of a Tier-2 small-group literacy intervention ('MiniLit') designed for young readers who are still struggling after experiencing whole-class initial instruction. A total of 22 students in Kindergarten and Year 2 at a New South Wales public school were randomly allocated to form two comparable groups. The experimental group received the Tier-2 small-group literacy intervention for one hour per day for four days per week for three school terms (27 weeks of instruction) while the control group continued to receive regular whole-class literacy instruction during this time. All students were assessed on four measures of reading and related skills before the intervention commenced, again after two terms of instruction and once more after three terms of instruction. Large and statistically significant mean differences between the two groups were evident at post-test on two of the four tests employed measuring phonological recoding and single word reading. Large effect sizes provided evidence for the efficacy of the small-group intervention for young struggling readers.

3030599,Rest of Europe,College/University,Professional Training,"; Background: The Stanford Faculty Development Center at Stanford University has developed a teaching improvement course for medical teachers that has been widely disseminated using a train-the-trainer model. Aims: This study was designed to investigate the relative impact of role playing as an instructional technique within that course for facilitating change in teaching behaviours. Method: From January 2009 to April 2010, six faculty development courses were delivered at Uppsala University Hospital to 48 physicians from different departments. The standard course presentation includes a range of instructional methods including short lectures, small group discussion, review of video re-enactments, role-play exercises and personal goal setting. For this study, participants were randomised to participate in (1) a ï¿½standardï¿½ course with role play or (2) an ï¿½alternativeï¿½ course with no role play. The effects of the course on teaching performance were assessed with retrospective pre- and post-course self-ratings of 29 specific teaching behaviours. Results: Self-assessment ratings indicated significantly greater positive changes in teaching behaviour among faculty who attended the standard course (with role play) as compared to those in the alternative course (p?=?0.015).

3031666,USA/Canada,Middle/High School,Behaviour and Social Wellbeing,"Background Yoga programmes geared for school children have become more widespread, but research regarding its impact on children is lacking. Several studies have reported positive outcomes, though there is a need for more RCTs. Objectives To determine the effects of yoga on children's emotional and behavioural functioning when compared with physical education (PE) classes. Methods Thirty middle school children were randomised to participate in either a school-based ashtanga-informed yoga or PE class three times a week for 12 weeks. Emotional (i.e. affect, self-perceptions) and behavioural (i.e. internalising and externalising problems, aggression) functioning were measured pre- and post-intervention. Results There were no significant changes between groups in self-reported positive affect, global self-worth, aggression indices or parent reports of their children's externalising and internalising problems. However, negative affect increased for those children participating in yoga when compared to the PE programme. Conclusions In general, findings suggest that yoga and PE classes do not differentially impact on middle school children's emotional and behavioural functioning. However, children reported experiencing increased negative emotions after receiving yoga while children in the PE group reported a decrease in these feelings. Implications of these results and potential directions for future research on children's yoga are discussed. 2014 Royal Pharmaceutical Society.",A randomised controlled trial comparing the impact of yoga and physical education on the emotional and behavioural functioning of middle school children,https://www.google.com/search?q=A+randomised+controlled+trial+comparing+the+impact+of+yoga+and+physical+education+on+the+emotional+and+behavioural+functioning+of+middle+school+children,2014,Universal,Mixture,Up to Half a Term,Behaviour and Social Wellbeing,None,Single,30,NA,Yes,Whole Sample Only,At Least Some Follow-Up,Yes,No,No,No,USA/Canada Middle/High School Behaviour and Social Wellbeing
3031320,UK/Ireland,College/University,Professional Training,"OBJECTIVE: To assess whether a new form of teaching, the 'donut round', is as good at imparting factual knowledge as interactive lectures in both the short-term and the long-term. DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial. SETTING: University of Oxford Medical School. PARTICIPANTS: 106 fifth year clinical medical students taught half of their A&E/trauma course by donut round and half by lecture. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The results of multiple choice questions (MCQs) divided according to how the material was taught. Three MCQ papers were set: one at the end of a four-week course, one approximately 10 weeks later and a final exam approximately 17 months after the first. RESULTS: At the first MCQ, the average result for questions taught by donut round was 41.0 (out of 50) and for those taught by conventional lecture was 40.1. At 10 weeks these averages fell to 36.3 and 37.3 and at 17 months they were 38.7 and 38.1, respectively. None of these pairs were significantly different. Ratios were calculated for each candidate by dividing their donut round score by their lecture score. The average ratios for the first, second and third MCQ papers were: 1.029, 1.007 and 1.027, respectively, and were not significantly different. The individual ratios of all candidates in all three MCQs were plotted against their equivalent total mark. The calculated linear regression showed a statistically significant advantage of donut rounds over lectures in those candidates who scored a total mark less than 89 (n=260, p=0.02).

DESIGN: Eight pairs of small Oregon communities (population 1700 to 13 500) were randomly assigned to receive a school based prevention programme or the school based programme plus a community programme. Effects were assessed through five annual surveys (time 1-5) of seventh and ninth grade (ages 12-15 years) students. INTERVENTION: The community programme included: (a) media advocacy, (b) youth anti-tobacco activities, (c) family communications about tobacco use, and (d) reduction of youth access to tobacco. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The prevalence of self reported smoking and smokeless tobacco use in the week before assessment. RESULTS: The community programme had significant effects on the prevalence of weekly cigarette use at times 2 and 5 and the effect approached significance at time 4. An effect on the slope of prevalence across time points was evident only when time 2 data points were eliminated from the analysis. The intervention affected the prevalence of smokeless tobacco among grade 9 boys at time 2. There were also significant effects on the slope of alcohol use among ninth graders and the quadratic slope of marijuana for all students.

3030948,Rest of Europe,Multiple,Behaviour and Social Wellbeing,"Aim: A randomised field trial was conducted to evaluate a school-based programme to prevent tobacco use in children and adolescents. Subject and methods: The trial included 534 children and 308 adolescents who were randomly selected to receive or not to receive the prevention programme. The prevention programme included: (a) health facts and the effect of smoking, (b) analysis of the mechanisms underlying intiation of smoking and (c) refusal skills training to deal with the social pressures to smoke. A questionnaire was administered before the intervention programme and 2 years later. Results: The prevalence rates of smoking in both groups of children and adolescents were increased at the end of the study. Anyway, the difference of smoking prevalence between the intervention and control groups was statistically significant only for the children's group (from 18.3 to 18.8% for the intervention group and from 17.8 to 26.9% in the control group) (p = 0.035). As regards reasons that induced the start of smoking, there was a significant increase of the issue 'because smokers are fools' (p = 0.004 for children; p < 0.001 for adolescents) and 'because smokers are irresponsible' (p < 0.001 for both children and adolescents) in the experimental groups. Conclusion: The results suggest that a school-based intervention programme addressing tobacco use among children and adolescents, based on the development of cognitive and behavioural aspects, can be effective. After 1 year of intervention, smoking prevalence was significantly lower in children belonging to the intervention group than in children not randomised to intervention. Targeting young children before they begin to smoke can be a successful way of prevention. 2010 Springer-Verlag.",A randomised controlled trial of a school-based intervention to prevent tobacco use among children and adolescents in Italy,https://www.google.com/search?q=A+randomised+controlled+trial+of+a+school-based+intervention+to+prevent+tobacco+use+among+children+and+adolescents+in+Italy,2010,Universal,Regular Teachers/Lecturers,Full Academic Year or Longer,Physical Health and Wellbeing,None,Single,842,NA,Yes,Some Sub-Groups Reported,At Least Some Follow-Up,Yes,"Yes, Limited","Yes, Descriptive Theory of Change",Yes,Rest of Europe Multiple Behaviour and Social Wellbeing

METHODS: We carried out a multicentre, single-blinded, randomised controlled trial with intention-to-treat analysis in three clinical schools attached to the University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania. Participants included 66 medical students in their final 2 years of study in 2009. Participants were block-randomised to either an intervention or a usual care control group. The intervention used an audio CD of guided mindfulness practice designed and produced for this trial. Participants were advised to use the intervention daily over the 8 weeks of the trial. All participants completed two self-report questionnaires, at baseline and at 8 weeks, respectively. The intervention group also completed a questionnaire at 16 weeks to provide follow-up data. The primary outcome measure was the difference over time in scores on the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). The secondary outcome measure referred to differences over time in scores on the subscales of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS). RESULTS: Mean baseline scores on the PSS and the stress component of the DASS were 15.7 (maximal score of 40) and 13.2 (maximal score of 42), respectively, both of which exceed scores in age-matched normative control data. Using multivariable analysis, participants in the intervention group demonstrated significant reductions in scores on the PSS (-ï¿½3.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] - 6.20 to -ï¿½0.68; pï¿½<ï¿½0.05) and the anxiety component of the DASS (-ï¿½2.82, 95% CI -ï¿½4.99 to -ï¿½0.64; p <ï¿½0.05).

Teachers are in a unique position to monitor children who are at risk and to intervene early with preventive social and emotional learning programmes. This study was designed to replicate very positive international evaluations of the FRIENDS for Life programme for anxiety reduction and extend the evidence base by investigating effects on strengths based qualities such as self- concept, coping and school connectedness. Further, for the first time in an Irish context primary school teachers were the lead facilitators of the programme, with 709 children aged 9 to 13 years in a representative sample of 27 primary schools from across Ireland. Schools were allocated to an intervention group or a wait-listed control group. Teachers were trained and supported to deliver the programme by educational psychologists. Quantitative and qualitative data including measures of anxiety, self-concept, coping, school connectedness and social validity indicated that the FRIENDS for Life programme was very positively received by children, parents and teachers. The programme was implemented successfully by teachers and resulted in positive outcomes for students including improved emotional wellbeing, greater coping skills and an enhanced sense of connectedness with school.

Each intervention was generally delivered three times per week for 13 weeks as part of a reading centre approach in Kindergarten classrooms with small groups of children. In the synthetic programme children showed, as predicted, significant (p less than 0.05) improvement in CV and VC word blending and the articulation of final consonants. The children in the analytic phonics programme showed, as predicted, significant (p less than 0.05) improvements in articulating shared rimes in words.

METHODS: A mixed methods study that included a randomised-controlled crossover trial with two intervention arms (usual teaching and PBL) and a nested qualitative study with focus groups to explore student perceptions of learning and to assess the effectiveness and utility of the two teaching methods.All 129 second-year medical students at the University of Hong Kong in 2007.The main outcomes measures were attitudes towards EBM; personal application and current use of EBM; EBM knowledge; future use of EBM. RESULTS: PBL was less effective at imparting knowledge than usual teaching consisting of a lecture followed by a group tutorial. After usual teaching students showed improvement in scores for 'attitudes towards EBM', 'personal application and current use of EBM' and 'EBM knowledge, which were not evident after PBL. In contrast to the usual teaching, students found PBL difficult as they lacked the statistical knowledge necessary to support discussion, failed to understand core concepts, and lost direction.

3030789,USA/Canada,Primary/Elementary,Behaviour and Social Wellbeing,"Background: Cogmed Working Memory Training (CWMT) has received considerable attention as a promising intervention for the treatment of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in children. At the same time, methodological weaknesses in previous clinical trials call into question reported efficacy of CWMT. In particular, lack of equivalence in key aspects of CWMT (i.e., contingent reinforcement, time-on-task with computer training, parent-child interactions, supportive coaching) between CWMT and placebo versions of CWMT used in previous trials may account for the beneficial outcomes favoring CWMT. Methods: Eighty-five 7- to 11-year old school-age children with ADHD (66 male; 78%) were randomized to either standard CWMT (CWMT Active) or a well-controlled CWMT placebo condition (CWMT Placebo) and evaluated before and 3 weeks after treatment. Dependent measures included parent and teacher ratings of ADHD symptoms; objective measures of attention, activity level, and impulsivity; and psychometric indices of working memory and academic achievement (Clinical trial title: Combined cognitive remediation and behavioral intervention for the treatment of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder; http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01137318). Results: CWMT Active participants demonstrated significantly greater improvements in verbal and nonverbal working memory storage, but evidenced no discernible gains in working memory storage plus processing/manipulation. In addition, no treatment group differences were observed for any other outcome measures. Conclusions: When a more rigorous comparison condition is utilized, CWMT demonstrates effects on certain aspects of working memory in children with ADHD; however, CWMT does not appear to foster treatment generalization to other domains of functioning.

3031392,USA/Canada,Middle/High School,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"INTRODUCTION: Relatively few well-designed smoking cessation studies have been conducted with teen smokers. This study examined the efficacy of extended cognitive-behavioral treatment in promoting longer term smoking cessation among adolescents. METHODS: Open-label smoking cessation treatment consisted of 10 weeks of school-based, cognitive-behavioral group counseling along with 9 weeks of nicotine replacement (nicotine patch). A total of 141 adolescent smokers in continuation high schools in the San Francisco Bay Area were randomized to either 9 additional group sessions over a 14-week period (extended group) or 4 monthly smoking status calls (nonextended group). Intention-to-treat logistic regression analysis was used to assess the primary outcome of biologically confirmed (carbon monoxide < 9 ppm) point prevalence abstinence at Week 26 (6-month follow-up from baseline). RESULTS: At Week 26 follow-up, the extended treatment group had a significantly higher abstinence rate (21%) than the nonextended treatment (7%; OR = 4.24, 95% CI: 1.20-15.02). Females also were more likely to be abstinent at the follow-up than males (OR = 4.15, 95% CI: 1.17-14.71).

3031136,USA/Canada,College/University,Study-Related Skills,"Self-concept has a variety of impacts in college students' lives. Specifically, academic self-concept has been shown to have stronger links to academic outcomes, including a negative impact for students with lower levels of academic self-concept. Several studies provided data that demonstrated an increase of self-concept is possible via the use of hypnosis (Markwell, 1965; Koe & Oldridge, 1987; De Vos & Louw, 2008), even when improving level of self-concept is not the direct goal. The main research question for this study is: Do participants who receive hypnosis treatment have significantly greater increases in their levels of academic self-concept than participants who receive the Hawthorne control group? To answer this research question, one independent variable with two levels and six dependent variables were utilized. The independent variable consisted of a treatment group, either hypnosis or Hawthorne control. The dependent variables consisted of six different measures tapping into different aspects of academic self-concept, including three scales from the Dimensions of Self-Concept Form H, Education Self Concept scale, Rosenberg Self-Esteem scale, and Test Anxiety Inventory. Participants were 35 undergraduate college students recruited from education classes. Random assignment was utilized for group selection. All participants participated for 5 one-hour sessions over a five week time period. At the end of the study, all participants completed post-intervention assessments. Results were calculated as follows. A two-group MANOVA was calculated to determine if there were significant differences pre-treatment between the two intervention groups. Results were not statistically significant (F = .50, p = .803), demonstrating there were not significant differences between the groups. A MANOVA was calculated to determine if there was statistical significance between the two treatment groups. Results indicated no statistical significance (Hotelling's Trace = .266, F=1.242, p=.315). A MANCOVA was also calculated to determine if any demographic variables were related to change in level of self-concept via the study, which again indicated no statistical significance. More importantly, this study sought to determine multivariate and univariate effect sizes for the level of effect hypnosis had on change in level of self-concept. Multivariate effect size was calculated and demonstrated almost no effect (D2 =.03). Univariate effect sizes with confidence intervals were calculated for treatment intervention and each of the dependent variables.

3031637,NA,NA,NA,"Background: Emergency resuscitation teams function in complex, dynamic working conditions. Such conditions present challenges to teams and threaten their ability to effectively communicate, coordinate, and recognize threats to patient safety. Efforts to improve team effectiveness have focused on team training. While some of these efforts have demonstrated promising results, feasibility issues limit their implementation. An easily implemented, low-resource-demand team training program could benefit institutions unable to support more resource-intensive efforts. Objectives: To determine the effect of a low-resource-demand, easily disseminated computer-based teamwork training intervention on teamwork behaviors and patient care performance in code teams. Methods: Design: A randomized comparison trial of computerbased teamwork training versus placebo training was conducted from August 2010 through March 2011. Setting and Subjects: Subjects (N=231) were fourth-year medical students and first-, second-, and third-year emergency medicine residents at Wayne State University. Each participant was assigned to a team of 4-6 members (Nteams=45). Interventions: Teams were randomly assigned to receive either a 25-minute evidence-based computer-based training module targeting appropriate resuscitation teamwork behaviors, or a placebo training module. Measurements: Teamwork behaviors and patient care behaviors were video recorded during high-fidelity simulated resuscitations and coded by trained raters blinded to condition assignment and study hypotheses. Teamwork behavior items (e.g., CXR findings communicated to team) were standardized before combining to create overall teamwork scores. Similarly, patient care items (e.g., CXR correctly interpreted) were standardized before combining to create overall patient care scores. Subject matter expert reviews and pilot testing of scenario content, teamwork items, and patient care items provided evidence of content validity. Results: When controlling for team members' medically relevant experience, teams in the training condition evidenced better teamwork (F(1,42) = 4.81, p < .05; g2p = 10%) and patient care (F(1,42) = 4.66, p < .05, g2p = 10%) than did teams in the placebo condition.

3030945,UK/Ireland,College/University,Professional Training,"Introduction: Feedback delivery is known to influence the quality of an educational experience. Whilst a plethora of techniques exist for its provision, the European Resuscitation Council (ERC) has for many years solely advocated the sandwich technique (ST) for use with basic life support (BLS) candidates. Its alternative, the learning conversation (LC), has however recently been gaining favour amongst other resuscitation bodies. Despite this, there remains an apparent paucity of research into their comparative effectiveness and we therefore sought to determine which out of the sandwich technique and learning conversation is superior for delivering feedback to BLS candidates. Methods: First year healthcare students within the University of Birmingham were voluntarily recruited to a randomized controlled trial between September and December 2013. Of 283 who enrolled, 143 candidates were in the ST arm. Candidates received eight hours tuition from 48 ERC-accredited BLS instructors, at a candidate:instructor ratio of 3:1 or less. Subsequent to training, candidates were required to undergo a competency-based assessment. All Instructors received four hours of feedback training. Validated questionnaires were distributed to instructors and candidates following the course and their subjective perceptions of the feedback were compared using visual analogues scales ranging from 0-10. Assessment results were also reviewed for both arms of the study. Results: Whilst objective exam results were comparable across both arms of the study, a significantly greater proportion of ST candidates considered that too much time was spent providing them with feedback (12.6% vs 1.4%; p < 0.05). Furthermore, LC instructors reported greater satisfaction with students' improvement following feedback in comparison to the ST group (7.3/10 vs 6.5/10; ns), however ST instructors reported greater understanding of their feedback technique (8.6/10 vs 7.1/10; ns).

3031216,Rest of Europe,Primary/Elementary,Behaviour and Social Wellbeing,"Background: Social skills training (SST) is a common intervention for children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) to improve their social and communication skills. Despite the fact that SSTs are often applied in clinical practice, the evidence for the effectiveness of these trainings for children with ASD is inconclusive. Moreover, long term outcome and generalization of learned skills are little evaluated. Additionally, there is no research on the influence of involvement of parents and teachers on effectiveness of SST and on the generalization of learned social skills to daily life. We expect parent and teacher involvement in SST to enhance treatment efficacy and to facilitate generalization of learned skills to daily life.Method/Design: In a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with three conditions, 120 participants with ASD at the end of primary school (10-12 years of calendar age) have been randomized to SST, SST-PTI (SST with Parent & Teacher Involvement), or care-as-usual. The SST consists of 18 group sessions of 1.5 hours for the children. In the SST-PTI condition, parents additionally participate in 8 parent sessions and parents and teachers are actively involved in homework assignments. Assessment takes place at three moments: before and immediately after the intervention period and at 6 months follow-up. Primary outcome is socialization, as an aspect of adaptive functioning. Secondary outcomes focus on specific social skills children learn during SST and on more general social skills pertaining to home and community settings from a multi-informant perspective. Additionally, possible predictors of treatment outcome will be assessed.Discussion: The current study is an RCT study evaluating SST in a large sample of Dutch children with ASD in a specific age range (10-12 years). Strengths of the study are the use of one manualized protocol, application of standardized and internationally used rating instruments, use of multiple raters, investigation of generalization of learned skills to daily life, and the evaluation of efficacy in the longer term by follow-up measures at 6 months after the end of training.Trial registration: NTR2405. 2014 Dekker et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",A randomized controlled study of a social skills training for preadolescent children with autism spectrum disorders: Generalization of skills by training parents and teachers?,https://www.google.com/search?q=A+randomized+controlled+study+of+a+social+skills+training+for+preadolescent+children+with+autism+spectrum+disorders:+Generalization+of+skills+by+training+parents+and+teachers?,2014,Targeted,Regular Teachers/Lecturers,Between Half and Full Term,Behaviour and Social Wellbeing,None,Single,120,NA,NA,Some Sub-Groups Reported,At Least Some Follow-Up,No,No,"Yes, Descriptive Theory of Change",No,Rest of Europe Primary/Elementary Behaviour and Social Wellbeing

Simulation-based training is recommended as an effective modality for instructing neonatal resuscitation and both low and high-fidelity manikin simulators are used. There is limited research that has compared the effect of low and high-fidelity manikin simulators for NRP learning outcomes, and more specifically on teamwork performance and confidence. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of using low versus high-fidelity manikin simulators in NRP instruction. A randomized posttest-only control group study design was conducted. Third year undergraduate medical students participated in NRP instruction and were assigned to an experimental group (high-fidelity manikin simulator) or control group (low-fidelity manikin simulator). Integrated skills station (megacode) performance, participant satisfaction, confidence and teamwork behaviour scores were compared between the study groups. Participants in the high-fidelity manikin simulator instructional group reported significantly higher total scores in overall satisfaction ( p = 0.001) and confidence ( p = 0.001). There were no significant differences in teamwork behaviour scores, as observed by two independent raters, nor differences on mandatory integrated skills station performance items at the p < 0.05 level. Medical students' reported greater satisfaction and confidence with high-fidelity manikin simulators, but did not demonstrate overall significantly improved teamwork or integrated skills station performance. Low and high-fidelity manikin simulators facilitate similar levels of objectively measured NRP outcomes for integrated skills station and teamwork performance.

This open randomized study aimed to assess the effect of portfolio learning in the teaching of oncology to medical students. The project aimed to provide the student with a holistic understanding of the impact of the disease and its treatment on the patient and family, and the natural history of malignant disease, through long-term personal experience of a cancer patient. All undergraduate medical students entering Clinical Studies in October 1992 at the University of Wales College of Medicine were randomized to a study or control group. Both groups continued with the standard curriculum. Each study-group student followed a patient with cancer for 9 months, supported by bi-monthly small-group tutorials. Tutors were either general practitioners or hospital consultants, not necessarily oncologists; each was supplied with a tutor's resource pack of key oncology review papers. Students recorded triggers to learning and key items in a personal learning portfolio. Students' performances in clinical examinations and the contents of their portfolio was assessed. Final assessment was by hidden questions in the objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) in the final degree examination, when students in the study group showed higher marks in factual knowledge of oncology, particularly amongst the weaker students (P = 0.01).

3031840,USA/Canada,College/University,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"Scope and Method of Study. Personalized Feedback Interventions (PFIï¿½s) have been supported in the literature for their effectiveness in reducing alcohol consumption and related consequences for college students. More recently, these interventions have been adapted to computer-based programs designed to disseminate these interventions a great number of individuals while limiting reliance on trained interventionists. While some of these PFIï¿½s include skills for moderating use, others have not included such modules. Both forms of the intervention have been shown to be effective. To date, there has not been a study to systematically examine the unique, or additive, contribution of skills modules. The current study sought to replicate and extend previous research on a computer-based PFI in order to test the utility of moderations skills (MS) modules. One hundred and fourteen participants were randomly assigned to an assessment only, a PFI, a PFI plus MS, or a MS only condition. Consumption and consequences variables were obtained at baseline and at one month follow-up. It was hypothesized that participants receiving PFI or PFI plus MS would demonstrate significantly greater reductions in alcohol use and related consequences compared to assessment only control groups, and that participants completing PFI plus MS would demonstrate significantly greater reductions in alcohol use and related consequences than all other groups. Findings and Conclusions. Results from the current study failed to support the utility of MS when combined with PFIï¿½s. Further, no significant interactions of time and condition were observed for any of the outcome variables. Results from the current investigation should be interpreted with caution given the small sample size and statistical power. Implications and future directions are discussed.

3031005,Asia,Middle/High School,Literacy/English,"Aim To compare test scores in English-error detection between Thai high school students undergoing self-learning by an online tool (computer-assisted learning: CAL) with versus without tuition/lecture. Methods This prospective, randomized, controlled study enrolled a sample of grade-12 high school students from a Thai secondary school. The predictor variable was the use of error-detection exercises in 9 separate 50-min tuition sessions during a 3-week period. Each subject was randomly assigned to receive a CAL program with or without tuition/lecture during the study interval: June- September 2009. The main outcome variable was the test scores of English-error identification. To measure the outcomes, the students were evaluated twice using the 25-question test within a 1-month interval (pre-test/posttest). Appropriate sample size estimates, descriptive, uni-, and bivariate statistics were calculated, and the level of statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. Results The sample included 69 students, 36 of whom (52.2%) were in the intervention group (CAL plus teaching). Within-group comparisons showed statistically significant improvements in post-test scores, regardless of learning methods (P < 0.05). Tuition/lecture was significantly associated with the improved post-test scores (P = 0.0012) and with a higher number of students showing improved post-test scores (P = 0.0007). Conclusions The results of this study suggest that tuition/lecture facilitates self-learning with CAL. In this sample, tuition/lecture still seems to be necessary for nonnative- English-speaking high school students to improve their English proficiency.

The program features the interweaving of material from other disciplines; emphasis on self-reflection; a mentoring relationship between students and teachers within the small groups; and opportunities to discuss and reflect on experiences that occurred during rotations. An evaluation of the program's effects involved analysis of career preferences and educational experiences, observed information on student performance, self-report data, and test data from standardized patient and National Board scores. These results showed that the New Pathway students preferred a student-directed environment, studied differently, and demonstrated a stronger orientation towards 'deep' learning. The students in the new curriculum were more humanistic in orientation, possessed better relational skills, and had superior knowledge of social and behavioral science.

3031195,USA/Canada,Primary/Elementary,Other School Subjects,"Background: Childhood asthma is a serious and common chronic disease that requires the attention of nurses and other school personnel. Schools are often the first setting that children take the lead in managing their asthma. Often, children are ill prepared for this role. Our study evaluated a school-based, multifaceted asthma program that targeted students with asthma and the broader school community. Methods: A randomized trial involving 130 schools with grades 1-5 and 1316 children with asthma and their families was conducted. Outcomes of interest for the child, at 1?year, were urgent care use and school absenteeism for asthma, inhaler technique, and quality of life, and for the school, at 14?months, were indicators of a supportive school environment. Results: Improvements were observed at the child and school level for the intervention group. Fewer children in the intervention group had a school absence (50% vs 60%; p?<?0.01), required urgent care for asthma (41% vs 51%; p?<?0.0001), or reported a day of interrupted activity (51% vs 63%; p?<0?.01), and had improved quality of life (5.8???1.2 vs 5.4???1.4; p?<?0.0001).

3031243,USA/Canada,Multiple,Literacy/English,"The purpose of this study was twofold: (1) to determine the efficacy of the Leveled Literacy Intervention program (LLI) in increasing reading achievement for K-2 students and (2) to examine LLI program implementation fidelity. This study evaluated LLI in two U.S. school districts and used a mixed-method design to address the following key research questions: 'what progress in literacy do students who receive LLI make compared to students who receive only regular classroom literacy instruction?' and 'was LLI implemented with fidelity to the developers' program model?' Five elementary schools in the Tift County School District (TCS) in Tifton, Georgia, and four elementary schools in the Enlarged City School District of Middletown (ECSDM) in Middletown, New York, volunteered to participate in the study. A total of 28 LLI teachers and 125 classroom teachers across both districts participated in this study. The findings of this evaluation indicate that LLI combined with regular classroom instruction can positively impact student literacy achievement to a greater degree than classroom instruction alone for K-2 students who are struggling with reading and writing. ELL and special education students can also benefit from the LLI program, some with strong, educationally significant effects. Robust effects were found on the LLI Benchmarks across all grade levels for students who received LLI. Students in LLI achieved between 1 1/2 benchmark levels up to almost 5 1/2 benchmark levels while students who did not receive LLI achieved between less than 1 benchmark level up to about 3 benchmark levels. Students in LLI also finished on par with grade-level goals. Further, because the majority of students in the study were economically disadvantaged, the findings indicate that the LLI program is effective with this high-risk population. However, the current study is limited in generalizability to rural and suburban populations, as well as those economically disadvantaged. The efficacy of the LLI program has important implications for schools and districts with limited resources and time available for early reading interventions. LLI's short-term, small-group format allows a greater number of struggling students to achieve grade-level competency within a shorter period of time. LLI's success with early learners also demonstrates its potential for reducing the development of chronic, long-term reading deficiencies and academic problems. Given the positive potential of the LLI program, future research is warranted in this area. Specifically, additional studies should be conducted in urban areas, and longitudinal tracking should be utilized to determine the long-term impact of LLI on students' literacy development.

3031517,Rest of Europe,Multiple,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"Aim: A randomised field trial was conducted to evaluate a school-based programme to prevent tobacco use in children and adolescents. Subject and methods: The trial included 534 children and 308 adolescents who were randomly selected to receive or not to receive the prevention programme. The prevention programme included: (a) health facts and the effect of smoking, (b) analysis of the mechanisms underlying intiation of smoking and (c) refusal skills training to deal with the social pressures to smoke. A questionnaire was administered before the intervention programme and 2 years later. Results: The prevalence rates of smoking in both groups of children and adolescents were increased at the end of the study. Anyway, the difference of smoking prevalence between the intervention and control groups was statistically significant only for the childrenï¿½s group (from 18.3 to 18.8% for the intervention group and from 17.8 to 26.9% in the control group) (p = 0.035). As regards reasons that induced the start of smoking, there was a significant increase of the issue ï¿½because smokers are foolsï¿½ (p = 0.004 for children; p < 0.001 for adolescents) and ï¿½because smokers are irresponsibleï¿½ (p &le; 0.001 for both children and adolescents) in the experimental groups. Conclusion: The results suggest that a school-based intervention programme addressing tobacco use among children and adolescents, based on the development of cognitive and behavioural aspects, can be effective. After 1 year of intervention, smoking prevalence was significantly lower in children belonging to the intervention group than in children not randomised to intervention. Targeting young children before they begin to smoke can be a successful way of prevention.

8155656,USA/Canada,Primary/Elementary,Range of Academic Outcomes,"Objective: This study evaluated the efficacy of a novel
psychosocial intervention (Collaborative Life Skills [CLS])
for primary-school students with attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms. CLS is a
12-week program consisting of integrated school, parent,
and student treatments delivered by school-based mental
health providers. Using a cluster randomized design, CLS
was compared with usual school/community services on
psychopathology and functional outcomes.
Method: Schools within a large urban public school district
were randomly assigned to CLS (12 schools) or usual
services (11 schools). Approximately 6 students participated
at each school (N ¼ 135, mean age 8.4 years, grade
range 2–5, 71% boys). Using PROC GENMOD (SAS 9.4),
the difference between the means of CLS and usual services
for each outcome at posttreatment was tested. To
account for clustering effects by school, the generalized
estimating equation method was used.
Results: Students from schools assigned to CLS compared
with those assigned to usual services had significantly
greater improvement on parent and teacher ratings of
ADHD symptom severity and organizational functioning,
teacher-rated academic performance, and parent ratings of
oppositional defiant disorder symptoms and social/interpersonal
skills.
Conclusion: These results support the efficacy of CLS
compared with typical school and community practices
for decreasing ADHD and oppositional defiant disorder
symptoms and improving key areas of functional
impairment. They further suggest that existing schoolbased
mental health resources can be redeployed from
non-empirically supported practices to those with
documented efficacy. This model holds promise for
improving access to efficient evidence-based treatment

The two treatments produced markedly different effects on test performance (measured by exam scores), with those receiving ABBT experiencing improvements in performance, whereas those receiving CT exhibited reduced performance. In addition, there was a suggestion that ABBT might have been more effective at reducing subjectively experienced test anxiety (i.e., a nonsignificant but medium-sized group by time interaction effect).

To address the need for improved educational outcomes, a previously tested consultation intervention called the Collaborative Model for Promoting Competence and Success (COMPASS; Ruble, Dalrymple, & McGrew, 2010; Ruble, Dalrymple, & McGrew, 2012) was evaluated in a 2nd randomized controlled trial, with the addition of a web-based group. Method: Forty-nine teacher-child dyads were randomized into 1 of 3 groups: (1) a placebo control (PBO) group, (2) COMPASS followed by face-to-face (FF) coaching sessions, and (3) COMPASS followed by web-based (WEB) coaching sessions. Three individualized goals (social, communication, and independence skills) were selected for intervention for each child. The primary outcome of independent ratings of child goal attainment and several process measures (e.g., consultant and teacher fidelity) were evaluated. Results: Using an intent-to-treat approach, findings replicated earlier results with a very large effect size (d = 1.41) for the FF group and a large effect size (d = 1.12) for the WEB group relative to the PBO group. There were no differences in overall change across goal domains between the FF and WEB groups, suggesting the efficacy of videoconferencing technology. Conclusions: COMPASS is effective and results in improved educational outcomes for young children with autism.

Methods: Twenty medical students participated in this randomized, controlled crossover study. Students were randomized to four groups. Each group received two simulations and two lectures covering four different topics. Students were administered a pre-test, post-test and delayed post-test. The mean percentage of questions answered correctly on each test was calculated. The mean of each student’s change in score across the three tests was used to compare simulation- versus lecture-based education. Results:  Students in both the simulation and lecture groups demonstrated improvement between the pre-test and post-test (p  0.05). When comparing interventions, the change in score between the pre-test and post-test was similar among both the groups (p > 0.05). The change in score between the post-test and delayed post-test was greater in the simulation group (p < 0.05).

Studies of parent-mediated and specialist-mediated JA-intervention suggest that such intervention may be effective. However, there is little knowledge about the success of the intervention when done in preschools. Aim: Assess the effects of a preschool-based JA-intervention. Methods: 61 children (48 males) with autistic disorder (29-60 months) were randomized to either 8 weeks of JA-intervention, in addition to their preschool programs (n = 34), or to preschool programs only (n = 27). The intervention was done by preschool teachers with weekly supervision by trained counselors from Child and Adolescent Mental Health Clinics (CAMHC). Changes in JA and JE were measured by blinded independent testers using Early Social Communication Scale (ESCS) and video taped preschool teacher-child and mother-child play at baseline and post-intervention. Clinical trials registration: Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00378157. Results: Intention-to-treat analysis showed significant difference between the intervention and the control group, with the intervention group yielding more JA initiation during interaction with the preschool teachers.

3031509,USA/Canada,Middle/High School,Behaviour and Social Wellbeing,"Background/Context: Billions of dollars are spent annually on professional development (PD) for educators, yet few randomized controlled trials (RCT) have demonstrated the ultimate impact PD has on student learning. Further, while policymakers and others speak to the role schools should play in developing students&apos; civic awareness, RCTs of PD designed to foster civic learning are rare. This randomized controlled trial contributes to the knowledge base on the effectiveness of PD designed to integrate civic learning, ethical reflection, and historical thinking skills into high school humanities courses. Focus of Study: The study examined the impact of a PD intervention in two areas: (a) teacher self-efficacy, burnout, and professional engagement and satisfaction; and (b) the academic, civic, social, and ethical competencies of 9th and 10th grade students in the teachers&apos; classes. Population/Participants/Subjects: The study involved 113 teachers and 1,371 9th and 10th grade students in 60 high schools from eight metropolitan regions in the United States. Intervention/Program/Practice: The intervention, Facing History and Ourselves, provides PD through a five-day seminar, curricular materials, and follow-up coaching and workshops to help teachers develop their capacities to implement an interdisciplinary historical case study unit using student-centered pedagogy. Research Design: The study used a school-level, randomized, experimental design to investigate impacts of the intervention for teachers and their 9th and 10th grade students. Findings/Results: Intervention teachers showed significantly greater self-efficacy in all eight assessed domains, more positive perceptions of professional support, satisfaction and growth, and greater personal accomplishment. Intervention students demonstrated stronger skills for analyzing evidence, agency, and cause and effect on an historical understanding performance measure; greater self-reported civic efficacy and tolerance for others with different views; and more positive perceptions of the classroom climate and the opportunities afforded for engaging with civic matters. Fidelity analysis found these causal effects despite the fact that roughly half of the intervention teachers did not fully implement the program. Conclusions/Recommendations: Educators need evidence-based approaches for teaching complex social, civic, and political issues enabling students of diverse mindsets and backgrounds to engage constructively with one another while obtaining necessary skills and knowledge.

Participants included 47 teens between 12 and 18 years of age with a diagnosis of ASD and a verbal intelligence quotient (IQ) &ge; 65. Eligible teens were randomly assigned to a treatment group (TG) or delayed treatment control group (CG). Primary outcome measures included questionnaires and direct observations quantifying social ability and problems directly related to ASD. Secondary outcome measures included scales for depressive symptoms, anxiety, and other behavioral problems. Rating scales for parental depressive symptoms and anxiety were examined to detect changes in parental psychosocial functioning throughout the PEERS&reg; treatment. Independent samples t?tests revealed no significant differences at baseline across the TG and CG conditions with regard to age (14.04 &plusmn; 1.64 and 13.54 &plusmn; 1.50 years), IQ (99.39 &plusmn; 18.09 & 100.67 &plusmn; 16.97), parental education, socioeconomic status, or ASD symptoms (p < 0.05), respectively. Results for treatment outcome suggest that the TG showed significant improvement in communication and social interaction domain scores on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, interpersonal relationship and play/leisure time on the subdomain scores of the Korean version of the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (p's < 0.01), social skills knowledge total scores on the Test of Adolescent Social Skills Knowledgeï¿½Revised (p < 0.01), and decreased depressive symptoms on the Child Depression Inventory following treatment (p < 0.05). Analyses of parental outcome reveal a significant decrease in maternal state anxiety in the TG after controlling for potential confounding variables (p < 0.05). Despite cultural and linguistic differences, the PEERS&reg; social skills intervention appears to be efficacious for teens with ASD in Korea with modest cultural adjustment. In an RCT, participants receiving the PEERS&reg; treatment showed significant improvement in social skills knowledge, interpersonal skills, and play/leisure skills, as well as a decrease in depressive symptoms and ASD symptoms. This study represents one of only a few cross?cultural validation trials of an established evidence?based treatment for adolescents with ASD.

Plus programs on drug use and violence. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial of 24 schools, with 3 conditions: D.A.R.E. only, D.A.R.E. Plus, and delayed program control. SETTING: Schools and neighborhoods, primarily in Minneapolis-St Paul. PARTICIPANTS: All seventh-grade students in 24 schools in the academic year 1999-2000 (N = 6237 at baseline, 67.3% were white, and there was 84.0% retention at final follow-up). INTERVENTIONS: The middle and junior high school D.A.R.E. curriculum in the 16 schools that received D.A.R.E. only and D.A.R.E. Plus. In the 8 schoolts that received D.A.R.E. Plus, additional components included a peer-led parental involvement classroom program called 'On the VERGE,' youth-led extracurricular activities, community adult action teams, and postcard mailings to parents. The interventions were implemented during 2 school years, when the cohort was in the seventh and eighth grades. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana use; multidrug use; violence; and victimization, assessed at the beginning and end of seventh grade and at the end of eighth grade. Growth curve analytic methods were used to assess changes over time by condition. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between D.A.R.E. only and the controls; significant differences among boys between D.A.R.E. Plus and controls for tobacco, alcohol, and multidrug use and victimization; significant differences among boys between D.A.R.E.

3030606,USA/Canada,College/University,Professional Training,"; Background: Computer-based learning (CBL) is an effective form of medical education. Educators have developed recommendations for instructional design but there is only minimal research that evaluates these recommendations. Aim: To evaluate the effect of case-based questions contained in computer modules on learning efficacy. Methods: The authors conducted a randomized controlled trial in 124 medical students of two CBL PowerPoint modules-based on Medicare. The modules were identical except one contained 11 case-based scenarios followed by multiple choice questions. The primary outcome measurement was a previously validated, 11-item knowledge test taken at the end of the module and at the end of the academic year to test retention. Results: The students who studied the module with case-based questions answered one more item correctly in the first test (8.9 vs. 10.00 correct answers, p?=?0.001). This difference had disappeared by the time of the second test (4.2 vs. 4.7, p?=?0.095). Conclusions: This study shows that computer modules with case-based questions enhance learning in the short-term but at the expense of increased time and so decreased learning efficiency.

3030782,USA/Canada,Preschool/Kindergarten,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"In this article, we examine the impact of two universal, grade 1 preventive interventions on the onset of tobacco smoking as assessed in early adolescence. The classroom-centered (CC) intervention was designed to reduce the risk for tobacco smoking by enhancing teachers' behavior management skills in first grade and, thereby, reducing child attention problems and aggressive and shy behavior-known risk behaviors for later substance use. The family-school partnership (FSP) intervention targeted these early risk behaviors via improvements in parent-teacher communication and parents' child behavior management strategies. A cohort of 678 urban, predominately African-American, public school students were randomly assigned to one of three Grade 1 classrooms at entrance to primary school (age 6). One classroom featured the CC intervention, a second the FSP intervention, and the third served as a control classroom. Six years later, 81% of the students completed audio computer-assisted self-interviews. Relative to controls, a modest attenuation in the risk of smoking initiation was found for students who had been assigned to either the CC or FSP intervention classrooms (26% versus 33%) (adjusted relative risk for CC/control contrast=0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.34-0.96; adjusted relative risk for FSP/control contrast=0.69, 95% CI, 0.50-0.97).

Method: Fifty-two Cantonese-speaking, school-age children with language impairment were assigned randomly to either the SC or the NAR treatment arm. Seven children did not receive treatment as assigned. Intervention in both arms targeted the same complex syntactical structures. The SC group focused on sentence combination training, whereas the NAR group made use of narratives in which the target structures were embedded. Pretest and posttest performances measured using a standardized language assessment were subjected to analyses of covariance mixed-effect-model analyses of variance. Results: Children in both treatment arms demonstrated significant growth after 4 months of intervention. The main effect between treatment arms and time was not significant after controlling the pretest performance, suggesting that both treatment approaches showed similar effects. The main effect of time was significant. Conclusions: This study provided evidence to support language intervention in the school years in Cantonese-speaking children.

METHODS: This prospective, randomized controlled study conducted at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, between November 1997 and September 1998. A convenience sample of 84 health sciences students with no prior airway management experience was used. Participants were trained using an advanced airway manikin and then were randomly assigned to control (n=24), periodic feedback only (n=30), and independent practice plus periodic feedback (n=30) groups. Performance was measured by a 52-point weighted checklist at 0, 16, 25, and 40 weeks after the initial program. RESULTS: Group scores were analyzed using a mixed-model repeated-measures analysis of variance and Bonferroni-adjusted P values. Overall group (P =.0002) and time (P =.0001) effects were significant. At time 0, there was no statistical difference in mean scores between groups (range 45.0 to 45.2). Control group performance fell over the first time interval (0 to 16 weeks) (mean score=34.0, P =.002) and remained lower at all intervals without further significant change. Scores in the independent practice plus feedback group revealed no significant changes over time and were significantly higher than the control group throughout. Performance in the periodic feedback only group showed a nonsignificant trend to improved performance over the control group.

DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial from April 2000 through March 2003, with data collection before and after intervention and at 3, 6, and 12 months. SETTING: Northeast Philadelphia schools. PARTICIPANTS: Latinos aged 13 through 18 years (249 males and 304 females); 81.6% retained at 12-month follow-up. INTERVENTIONS: The HIV and health-promotion control interventions consisted of six 50-minute modules delivered by adult facilitators to small, mixed-gender groups in English or Spanish. Main Outcome Measure Self-reported sexual behavior. RESULTS: Analyses using generalized estimation equations over the follow-up period revealed that adolescents in the HIV intervention were less likely to report sexual intercourse (odds ratio, 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.46-0.96), multiple partners (odds ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.31-0.90), and days of unprotected intercourse (relative risk, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.26-0.84) and more likely to report using condoms consistently (odds ratio, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.24-2.93).

3030891,NA,NA,NA,"BACKGROUND: Children with (treated for) brain tumours are at risk for impaired social competence and reduced quality of life (QOL). Intervention programs targeting the social competence deficits of these children have received little empirical attention. OBJECTIVE: To determine if pediatric brain tumour (PBT) patients receiving a manualized group social skills training intervention program (SSIP; Experimental Group (EG)) improves social skills and QOL when compared to an Attention Control Group (CG). HYPOTHESIS: When compared to the CG, children in the EG will experience improved social skills and QOL. METHODS: This study employed a multisite randomized controlled trial (RCT) design with repeated measures. INCLUSION CRITERIA: PBT patients ages 8 to 16 years, in stable condition and attending school regularly. Both groups underwent 8 two-hour weekly group sessions and three assessments (pre, post, 6 month follow-up). In the EG, sessions consisted of manualized social skills training through games and crafts; CG sessions focused on socialization through games and crafts without skill training. Outcome measures included parent and self-reported social skills (Social Skills Rating System) and QOL (PedsQL4.0). Outcomes were compared using repeated-measures ANOVAs. RESULTS: Preliminary analyses were based on 42 PBT patients (21 per group) having completed all three assessments. Self Report: Group differences suggested improved cooperation in the EG (2 = 0.11) and greater empathy in EG than in CG (2 = 0.09); and positive changes in PedsQL feelings in the EG over time (2 = 0.14). Parent Report: A group by time interaction suggested improved social functioning in the EG over time (2 = 0.15). Finally, cooperation and emotional functioning improved over time across both groups (2 = 0.26 & h2 = 0.31). CONCLUSION: Preliminary findings suggest SSIP as a promising means to improve social competence and QOL of children with PBT based on parent and self-report.

The Diabetes Check is a brief structured interaction that was designed to facilitate patient-pharmacist conversations about monitoring A1c, blood pressure and cholesterol (diabetes ABCs). METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted where students in the intervention group performed five to ten Diabetes Checks. In the control group, students performed two drug-profile reviews for patients with diabetes. Students completed a pre- and post-assessment of the frequency of monitoring behaviour and attitudes, including self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, role beliefs (counselling role orientation and monitoring role orientation) and mattering. Improvements in behaviours and attitudes were assessed with bivariate and multiple linear regression. The study setting was University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Pharmacy and its affiliated Ambulatory Pharmaceutical Care Clerkship community pharmacies. KEY FINDINGS: Of 130 students, 119 (92%) completed surveys at both time points. Students who completed the Diabetes Check intervention had greater improvements in the frequency of monitoring patients' A1c values and in their counselling role orientation than control group students.

3030989,Asia,Middle/High School,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"BACKGROUND: Tobacco use is a significant public health problem in China. Culturally specific smoking prevention programs are needed for Chinese adolescents. This study evaluated a school-based smoking prevention curriculum with a social normative approach developed in the United States for adolescents in urban Wuhan, China. METHODS: As a randomized trial, the intervention was implemented in 1998 with 7th grade students in seven schools with seven matched control schools. Multilevel logistic regression models were used to compare ever and recent (past-month) smoking behaviors for the control and program conditions. RESULTS: At the 1-year follow-up, smoking had increased more rapidly in the control schools than in the program schools. The odds of baseline nonsmokers initiating smoking did not differ between the program and control groups (OR=1.08 with 95% CI=0.71, 1.64). The program prevented progression to recent smoking among boys who were baseline ever smokers. Among boys who were recent smokers at baseline, the prevention program significantly reduced risk of remaining recent smokers at follow-up (OR=0.45 with 95% CI=0.23, 0.88). CONCLUSIONS: This social normative smoking prevention curriculum did not demonstrate a significant primary prevention effect but showed potential for secondary prevention.

Aims: To study the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of CMs in problem-based learning (PBL) tutorials. Method: Students and tutors were randomized to tutorials that used or did not use CMs. A mixed-methods approach generated qualitative and quantitative results of participantsï¿½ perspectives on and the effects of CMs in PBL tutorials. Results: Student survey response rate was 71% (122/172). Most students (82.6%) planned to use CMs in the future at least occasionally, and students in CM tutorials endorsed increased likelihood of using CMs in the future (p?=?0.02) versus students in non-CM tutorials. Qualitative analyses identified consistent associations between CMs and recurrent themes: integration of physiological mechanisms, challenging studentsï¿½ knowledge of the material, and identification of knowledge gaps. Quantitative assessment of final exam scores revealed a statistically significant increase in the studentsï¿½ scores in CM tutorials versus students in non-CM tutorials with an a priori a of <0.10.

3030731,Australia/New Zealand,Middle/High School,Behaviour and Social Wellbeing,"Objective: To conduct a placebo-controlled study of the effectiveness of a universal school-based depression prevention program. Method: Three hundred ninety-two students age 13 to 15 from two schools were randomized to intervention (RAP-Kiwi) and placebo programs run by teachers. RAP-Kiwi was an 11-session manual-based program derived from cognitive-behavioral therapy. The placebo was similar but with cognitive components removed. Outcomes were self-rated depression scales, the Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale (RADS), and the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II). Follow-up was to 18 months. Analysis was done on an intent-to-treat basis. Results: Immediately after the intervention, depression scores were reduced significantly more by RAP-Kiwi than by placebo, with a mean difference in change from baseline between groups of 1.5 on BDI-II (CI > 0.38, p = .01) and 2.24 on RADS (CI > 0.22, p = .04). Categorical analysis confirmed significant clinical benefit with an absolute risk reduction of 3% (95% CI, 1-11%, McNemar chi square], p = .03), with the 'number needed to treat' for short-term benefit of 33. Group differences in depression scores averaged across time to 18 months were significant on RADS but not on BDI-II. Retention rates were 91% at 6 months and 72% at 18 months. Conclusions: The RAP-Kiwi program is a potentially effective public health measure.

A total of 94 treatment students and 194 comparison students from four randomized intermediate schools participated in the current project. The intervention consisted of ongoing professional development and specific instructional science lessons with inquiry-based learning, direct and explicit vocabulary instruction, and integration of reading and writing. Results suggested that (a) there was a significantly positive treatment effect as reflected in students' higher performance in district-wide curriculum-based tests of science and reading and standardized tests of science, reading, and English reading fluency; (b) males and females did not differ significantly from participating in science inquiry instruction; (c) African-American students had lower chance of sufficiently mastering the science concepts and achieving above the state standards when compared with Hispanic students across gender and condition, and (d) below-poverty African-American females are the most vulnerable group in science learning. Our study confirmed that even a modest amount of literacy integration in inquiry-based science instruction can promote students' science and reading achievement. Therefore, we call for more experimental research that focus on the quality of literacy-integrated science instruction from which middle grade students, particularly low-socio-economic status students, can benefit.

Thirty two girls (aged between 10 and 11 years) in a residential school were matched as pairs for age and randomly assigned to the two groups. The groups practiced the assigned interventions as 75 minutes every day for 7 days a week. Depth perception was assessed using a standard apparatus measuring errors in 5 trials per subject.

8154672,Asia,Primary/Elementary,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"Objective: Dog-bite injuries pose significant threat to children globally. School-age children are especially at risk because of their insufficient safety knowledge and cognitively immature tendency toward low perceived vulnerability to bites, and this risk is elevated further for school-age children living in rural China due to the large number of stray dogs, all potential rabies carriers, present in their communities. Method: This randomized controlled trial evaluated whether viewing an educational video of testimonials would change safety knowledge, perceived vulnerability, and simulated behaviors with dogs among a sample of 280 third and fourth graders living in rural China. Participants were randomly assigned to view either an educational video of testimonials on dog-bite prevention (treatment) or an educational video of testimonials on drowning prevention (comparison). Safety knowledge, perceived vulnerability to dog bites, and simulated behavior with dogs using a dollhouse model were assessed both before and after exposure to the video of testimonials. Results: Children who watched the educational video of testimonials on dog-bite prevention had increased safety knowledge, higher perceived vulnerability, and less risky simulated behaviors with dogs compared with the comparison group. Mediation analysis revealed that the intervention successfully changed children’s simulated behaviors with dogs through greater safety knowledge and increased perceived vulnerability. Conclusions: Results suggest the incorporation of testimonials into injury prevention programs has potential for broad global dissemination. The fact that both increased knowledge and heightened perceived vulnerability mediated changes in simulated behavior suggests the dual roles of knowledge and appraisal on children’s injury-risk behavior.

This study reports the results of a randomized trial of a parent engagement intervention designed to facilitate school readiness among disadvantaged preschool children, with a particular focus on language and literacy development. Participants included 217 children, 211 parents, and 29 Head Start teachers in 21 schools.

3031318,USA/Canada,Primary/Elementary,Behaviour and Social Wellbeing,"Objective: Interventions for peer problems among children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) typically focus on improving these children's behaviors. This study tested the proposition that an adjunctive component encouraging the peer group to be socially inclusive of children with ADHD would augment the efficacy of traditional interventions. Method: Two interventions were compared: contingency management training (COMET), a traditional behavioral management treatment to improve socially competent behavior in children with ADHD, and Making Socially Accepting Inclusive Classrooms (MOSAIC), a novel treatment that supplemented behavioral management for children with ADHD with procedures training peers to be socially inclusive. Children ages 6.8-9.8 (24 with ADHD; 113 typically developing TD]) attended a summer day program grouped into same-age, same-sex classrooms with previously unacquainted peers. Children with ADHD received both COMET and MOSAIC with a repeated measures crossover design. TD children provided sociometric information about the children with ADHD. Results: Whereas the level of behavior problems displayed by children with ADHD did not differ across treatment conditions, children with ADHD displayed improved sociometric preference and more reciprocated friendships, and received more positive messages from peers, when they were in MOSAIC relative to COMET. However, the beneficial effects of MOSAIC over COMET predominantly occurred for boys relative to girls. Conclusions: Data support the concept that adjunctive procedures to increase the inclusiveness of the peer group may ameliorate peer problems among children with ADHD, and suggest the potential utility of modifying MOSAIC to be delivered in regular classroom settings.

The effects of the intervention were investigated using multiple-level modeling over four assessment periods (pretreatment, 1 week of intervention, 2 weeks of intervention, and 1-week follow-up). Results were consistent across dependent measures, with rates of growth and follow-up scores significantly higher for the intervention group as compared with the control group.

3030908,Australia/New Zealand,College/University,Professional Training,"PURPOSE: To conduct a controlled trial of traditional and problem-based learning (PBL) methods of teaching epidemiology. METHOD: All second-year medical students (n = 136) at The University of Western Australia Medical School were offered the chance to participate in a randomized controlled trial of teaching methods for an epidemiology course. Students who consented to participate (n = 80) were randomly assigned to either a PBL or a traditional course. Students who did not consent or did not return the consent form (n = 56) were assigned to the traditional course. Students in both streams took identical quizzes and exams. These scores, a collection of semi-quantitative feedback from all students, and a qualitative analysis of interviews with a convenience sample of six students from each stream were compared. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in performances on quizzes or exams between PBL and traditional students. Students using PBL reported a stronger grasp of epidemiologic principles, enjoyed working with a group, and, at the end of the course, were more enthusiastic about epidemiology and its professional relevance to them than were students in the traditional course. PBL students worked more steadily during the semester but spent only marginally more time on the epidemiology course overall. Interviews corroborated these findings. Non-consenting students were older (p < 0.02) and more likely to come from non-English-speaking backgrounds (p < 0.005).

3031608,NA,NA,NA,"Introduction We report preliminary results from a study in 17 schools examining the efficacy of 2 computerbased attention training systems in teaching children with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) to concentrate more effectively. Several studies suggest that attention training using neurofeedback may result in decreased symptoms of ADHD and improved academic performance and behavior at school. In one such study of 100 children on stimulant medication (Monastra, Monastra, & George, 2002), only the participants who received additional neurofeedback sustained the positive gains after the stimulant medication was discontinued. A small, randomized controlled trial of neurofeedback with a waitlist control (Linden, Habib, & Radojevic, 1996) demonstrated improvements in behavioral symptoms of ADHD. Unfortunately, there were only 18 participants, so there was insufficient power to demonstrate a statistically significant difference between the groups. We compared a neurofeedback (NFB) computer attention training system that teaches children to alter their brainwave activity with a Standard Computer Format attention training system (SCF). We hypothesize that both treatments will show improvement in ADHD symptoms and academic outcomes compared to a control condition. Methods Forty-five children with ADHD in Grades 2 and 4 were randomly assigned to receive the NFB, SCF, or a waitlist-control condition (WLC) that receives NFB or SCF the following academic year. Children received forty 45-min sessions 3 times a week at school for 4 months. As part of a comprehensive assessment, we report data on the T-SKAMP completed by teachers that assesses symptoms of ADHD in the classroom; the PERMP, a math test completed by students that analyzes speed and accuracy; and the BOSS, double-blind classroom observations. Intervention/Program/Practice The neurofeedback intervention system used is commercially available and was chosen for several reasons: (a) The NFB component is directed at increased theta waves and decreased beta waves in the frontal cortex, which are the most frequently observed cortical deficits in children with ADHD, and (b) it uses EEG sensors that are embedded in a bicycle helmet, as opposed to EEG sensors placed directly on the scalp with wires, which significantly eases delivery in children. This system includes different tasks to train attention stamina, visual tracking (as required in the classroom), increased time-on-task, short-term memory and sequencing, and discriminatory processing. As the child advances, she or he progresses to more challenging tasks that include visual and auditory distractions, such as colorful shapes moving around on the screen and background noise. The SCF intervention used is also commercially available and was chosen for several reasons: (a) It includes an extensive array of cognitive exercises that target many areas of attention as well as working memory, and (b) the SCF system is designed to improve sustained concentration and working memory through a variety of specific interactive exercises manipulated with a standard computer mouse and keyboard. The exercises aim to maximize attention, decrease impulsivity, and train auditory and visual working memory. The tasks become more challenging as the participant progresses. Results Wave 1 participants include 41 children diagnosed with ADHD in Grades 2 and 4. We conducted preliminary analyses of variance of the PERMP, T-SKAMP, and BOSS (see Tables 3 and 4, Appendix B, in the paper). The NFB intervention group showed improvement on the number of math problems correct on the PERMP math test (p=.03), indicating an increase in accuracy as well as an increase in number of problems attempted on the PERMP math test (p=.02), illustrating an increase in speed. The NFB intervention group also demonstrated a decrease in ADHD symptoms as reported by teachers on the T-SKAMP Attention scale (p=.01). The SCF group showed improvement on the number of problems correct on the PERMP math test (p=.01) indicating an increase in accuracy, and a trend toward decreased ADHD symptoms on the T-SKAMP. The WLC showed no significant effects on either the PERMP or the T-SKAMP. The BOSS showed a trend toward ADHD symptom reduction in the classroom setting. Conclusion Our preliminary data from a 4-year study evaluating the efficacy of 2 computer-based attention training systems in schools shows significant results and promising trends. As this is a preliminary analysis of preliminary data, we have not addressed all of the study's aims and have not yet compared data between the 3 intervention groups. Teacher report of ADHD symptoms, math achievement by students, and objective classroom observations for our first wave were analyzed. Our preliminary data on these outcome measures suggest that computer-based attention training programs offered in an elementary school setting may be effective in reducing symptoms of ADHD and improved math achievement. We hope that analysis of full data collected after the intervention of Wave 2 will consolidate our findings and further explore the feasibility and effectiveness of computer attention training as a method to support children with attention issues in schools.",A randomized trial of computer attention training in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder,https://www.google.com/search?q=A+randomized+trial+of+computer+attention+training+in+children+with+attention-deficit/hyperactivity+disorder,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA NA NA

Program development is described along with results of the initial randomized controlled trial. We tested the hypotheses that children randomized to participate in MBCT-C would show greater reductions in (a) attention problems, (b) anxiety symptoms, and (c) behavior problems than wait-listed age and gender-matched controls. Participants were boys and girls aged 9-13 (N = 25), mostly from low-income, inner-city households. Twenty-one of 25 children were ethnic minorities. A randomized cross-lagged design provided a wait-listed control group, a second trial of MBCT-C, and a 3-month follow-up of children who completed the first trial. Measures included the Child Behavior Checklist, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children, and Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children. Participants who completed the program showed fewer attention problems than wait-listed controls and those improvements were maintained at three months following the intervention F (1, 1, 18) = 5.965, p = 0.025, Cohen's d = 0.42]. A strong relationship was found between attention problems and behavior problems (r = 0.678, p less than 0.01). Reductions in attention problems accounted for 46% of the variance of changes in behavior problems, although attention changes proved to be a non-significant mediator of behavior problems (p = 0.053). Significant reductions in anxiety symptoms and behavior problems were found for those children who reported clinically elevated levels of anxiety at pretest (n = 6).

Many universities have initiated strategies to improve graduation rates, by focusing on the actual activities necessary to organize and complete school work. However, although academic-related skills do predict academic performance, research suggests that motivational factors may mediate the execution of behaviors involved with self-regulated learning required for success in college.

3030652,Asia,Primary/Elementary,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"Introduction Family- and school-based interventions for childhood obesity have been widely applied; however, the prevalence of childhood obesity remains high. The purpose of this RCT is to evaluate the effectiveness of a family-individual-school-based comprehensive intervention model. Design Cluster RCT. Setting/participants Fourteen primary schools were selected from 26 primary schools in a district of Shanghai, China, and then randomly divided into intervention and control groups with seven schools in each. The trial started with first-grade students. A total of 1,287 students in the intervention group and 1,159 in the control group were studied overall. Intervention The baseline study was conducted in January 2011, and family-individual-school-based interventions started in March 2011 and ended in December 2013 for intervention group students. Three follow-up studies were conducted in January 2012, January 2013, and January 2014. Data analysis was conducted in March 2014. Main outcome measures Students' weight and height were measured. The prevalence of obesity/overweight and BMI z-scores were calculated and analyzed using a generalized estimating equation approach. Results The overall prevalence of overweight/obesity declined from 28.92% in 2011 to 24.77% in 2014, with a difference of 4.15% in the intervention group compared with a 0.03% decline (from 30.71% to 30.68%) in the control group. The intervention group had significantly lower odds of developing obesity or overweight and had decreased average BMI z-scores compared with the control group, especially for obese or overweight students.

A randomized, controlled trial was conducted with 120 early adolescents (72 girls, 48 boys; ageï¿½=ï¿½11-15 years) who had elevated depressive symptoms and were selected from a school-based population. Measures of internalizing problems, externalizing problems, personal adjustment, school problems, and interpersonal relations were obtained from parents, youth, and/or teachers at preintervention (Time 1) and postintervention (Time 2, 5-7 months after preintervention). General linear model repeated measures analyses yielded a significant Groupï¿½× Time interaction on youth-reported, but not parent-reported, depressive symptoms and internalizing symptoms. Youth in the PTA group showed greater decreases following intervention compared to youth who received ISP, yielding effect sizes (Cohen's d) of 0.36 for depressive symptoms, 95% CI [-.02, .73], and 0.44, 95% CI [.05, .82], for internalizing symptoms. PTA youth also showed improvements in their personal adjustment (sense of inadequacy, self-esteem), and parent-reported social skills, but no differences emerged between groups for externalizing symptoms, school problems, or interpersonal relationships.

3031461,USA/Canada,Primary/Elementary,Behaviour and Social Wellbeing,"To attain academic goals, school personnel must effectively manage 20% of students who engage in the disruptive behaviors that interrupt instruction, create teacher stress, and contribute to poor student outcomes. Without effective strategies, school personnel often respond to disruptive students with ineffective authoritarian tactics, exclusionary policies, and special education referrals. However, federal policies aim to improve student outcomes and reduce special education referrals. To achieve these goals, schools are integrating universal, selective, and indicated practices and programs in tiered response models. Though many effective universal programs exist, only a few selective programs are available. The few available and widely-used selective strategies are rooted in behaviorism, managed by school personnel, and do not integrate scientifically-based efforts that improve self-management outcomes for students. The purpose of the dissertation was to study the effectiveness of STARS, a manualized self-monitoring program designed to be a selective strategy within a tiered response model. The study relied upon a randomized trial with 108 disruptive students across 42 classrooms and 7 schools. Results indicated STARS was feasible, acceptable, and related to improvements in behavior, social competence, authority acceptance, and student-teacher relations. Mediation models confirm direct instruction through STARS in social competencies caused improvements in student behaviors.

Results indicated no main effects for the experimental curriculum. Following the initial analyses, fidelity of implementation in the experimental classrooms was examined and results indicated that children in classrooms rated as having high fidelity of implementation significantly outperformed low-implementing classrooms on two important phonological awareness measures. This trend favoring high-implementing classrooms was also evident on measures of letter-name knowledge, and beginning sounds.

3031665,USA/Canada,Middle/High School,Behaviour and Social Wellbeing,"Purpose: Our research of MBSR for mostly female urban youth showed reductions in conflict, anxiety, and stress, as well as increased selfregulation. Reviews of mindfulness instruction suggest benefit but call for increased methodological rigor, particularly active control conditions. Here, we explore the specific effects of MBSR compared with an active control on stress and coping among young urban males. Methods: Participants were 7th and 8th grade boys in a small urban middle school for boys. They were randomly assigned to MBSR or an active control (Healthy Topics-HT), an age-appropriate health education program, designed to control for positive adult instructor, learning new information, and class time. Data were collected at baseline, postprogram, and three-month follow-up on psychological symptoms, stress, mindfulness, coping; sleep; teacher-rated behavior; and salivary cortisol, a physiologic measure of stress. Results: Forty-one (22 MBSR and 19 HT) boys participated. Ninety-five percent were African American, with a mean age of 12.5 years. There were no significant differences at baseline between groups. Following the programs, MBSR boys had significantly less anxiety (p=0.01), less rumination (p=0.02), and less negative coping (p=0.06) than HT boys. From pre- to post-program, daily cumulative cortisol levels increased during the academic terms for HT participants at a trend level (p=0.07) but remained constant for MBSR participants (p=0.33). Otherwise, we did not detect differences in outcomes. Conclusion: This study of MBSR compared with an active control for urban male youth shows less rumination, anxiety, and an attenuation of cortisol increase among MBSR participants. These results suggest that MBSR specifically enhances self-regulatory processes for urban male youth, including improved coping and emotion regulation. Additional research is needed to explore the impact of mindfulness instruction for urban male youth on self-regulation, the duration of its effect, and related social, psychological, and behavioral outcomes.","A randomized, active-controlled trial of school-based mindfulness instruction for urban middle-school male youth","https://www.google.com/search?q=A+randomized,+active-controlled+trial+of+school-based+mindfulness+instruction+for+urban+middle-school+male+youth",2012,Universal,Regular Teachers/Lecturers,Between Half and Full Term,None,None,Single,41,NA,yes,Whole Sample Only,Immediate Post-Test Only,no,No,"Yes, Descriptive Theory of Change",no,USA/Canada Middle/High School Behaviour and Social Wellbeing

3031441,USA/Canada,Middle/High School,Behaviour and Social Wellbeing,"PURPOSE: Few studies have rigorously evaluated school-based interventions to reduce violence and substance use in high school students, especially Latinos. This study assessed the effects of a school-based program on reducing violence and substance use among primarily Latino high school students. METHODS: Ninth-grade students at risk for violence and substance use were randomized to intervention or control groups. The intervention was based on an existing program developed for white and African American youth. Data on smoking, alcohol and drug use, fighting, and grades were collected at baseline and 4 and 8 months post enrollment. RESULTS: There were 55 students in the control and 53 in the intervention group; 74% of controls and 78% of intervention students were Latino. There were no significant changes in fighting, smoking, or alcohol or drug use, from baseline to 8-month follow-up, between the intervention and control group. Pre and post grade point average (GPA) decreased from 2.3 at baseline to 1.8 at follow-up (p<.01) in the intervention group, with no significant between-group changes in GPA from baseline to follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: This school-based program showed no reduction in violence or substance use. The findings suggest that a program targeting non-Latino youth may not be optimal for reducing violence and substance use in Latinos; greater attention to cultural appropriateness and racial/ethnic differences may be needed. There was a decrease in intervention-group GPA but no significant change compared with controls. Further studies of the impact of school-based substance use and violence prevention programs on academics, and the effectiveness of afterschool or community-based programs compared to school-based programs are needed.","A randomized, controlled trial of a school-based intervention to reduce violence and substance use in predominantly Latino high school students","https://www.google.com/search?q=A+randomized,+controlled+trial+of+a+school-based+intervention+to+reduce+violence+and+substance+use+in+predominantly+Latino+high+school+students",2011,Targeted,Other School/College Employees,More than One Term,Physical Health and Wellbeing,none,Single,108,NA,No,Some Sub-Groups Reported,At Least Some Follow-Up,Yes,"Yes, Fairly Well","Yes, Descriptive Theory of Change",Yes,USA/Canada Middle/High School Behaviour and Social Wellbeing
3030990,USA/Canada,Primary/Elementary,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"OBJECTIVE: Several educational theorists have suggested that young children are unlikely to benefit from detailed instruction regarding AIDS prevention because of inherent developmental cognitive limitations. This study aims to determine whether AIDS education in the elementary grades can advance young children's understanding of this illness. METHODS: A randomized, controlled trial was used to measure the impact of a 3-week, multifaceted AIDS education program on conceptual understanding, factual knowledge, and fears about AIDS in 189 students in grades kindergarten through 6th. The ASK (AIDS Survey for Kids), a standardized, semistructured interview that measures conceptual understanding, factual information, and fears about AIDS, was administered before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Children in the intervention group, as compared to those in the control group, showed significant (P < .0001) gains in their level of understanding of the concepts of causality and prevention of AIDS. These results were unaffected by controlling for grade, gender, race, socioeconomic status, and verbal fluency. The gains in children's understanding of causality of AIDS represented at least 2 years' growth in the level of conceptual sophistication and persisted at a follow-up evaluation several months later. After the intervention, more children (P < .001) in the intervention group than in the control group accurately identified causes of AIDS in response to open-ended questions: germ/germ theory (41% vs 13%), mother-to-infant transmission (54% vs 15%), blood transmission (83% vs 40%), and sexual transmission (56% vs 30%). Fewer than half as many children in the intervention group responded incorrectly to each of five direct questions about transmission of HIV through casual contact. The intervention did not increase children's fears about the illness. CONCLUSIONS: A short, developmentally based, multifaceted AIDS education program in the elementary grades can advance children's conceptual understanding and factual knowledge about AIDS and decrease their misconceptions about casual contact as a means of acquiring the illness, without increasing their fears. Significant advances in conceptual understanding about AIDS can be achieved through direct educational interventions.","A randomized, controlled trial of a school-based, multi-faceted AIDS education program in the elementary grades: the impact on comprehension, knowledge and fears","https://www.google.com/search?q=A+randomized,+controlled+trial+of+a+school-based,+multi-faceted+AIDS+education+program+in+the+elementary+grades:+the+impact+on+comprehension,+knowledge+and+fears",1995,Universal,External Educators,Up to Half a Term,None,None,Clustered,189,NA,Yes,Some Sub-Groups Reported,At Least Some Follow-Up,Yes,"Yes, Limited","Yes, Theoretical Perspectives",Yes,USA/Canada Primary/Elementary Physical Health and Wellbeing

We present the primary results of a pilot, randomized, controlled trial to encourage calling 911 for witnessed stroke among middle school children and their parents. METHODS: This project occurred in Corpus Christi, an urban Texas community of 325,000. Three intervention and 3 control schools were randomly selected. The intervention contained 12 hours of classroom instruction divided among sixth, seventh, and eighth grades. Parents were educated indirectly through homework assignments. Two-sample t tests were used to compare pretest and posttest responses. RESULTS: Domain 1 test questions involved stroke pathophysiology. Intervention students improved from 29% to 34% correct; control students changed from 28% to 25%. Domain 2 test questions involved stroke symptom knowledge. Intervention school students changed from 28% correct to 43%; control school students answered 25% correctly on the pretest and 29% on the posttest. Domain 3 test questions involved what to do for witnessed stroke. Intervention school students answered 36% of questions correctly on the pretest and 54% correctly on the posttest, whereas control students changed from 32% correct to 34%. A comparison of change in the mean proportion correct over time between intervention and control students was P<0.001 for each of the 3 individual domains. A poor parental response rate impaired the ability to assess parental improvement.

RESULTS: There was no difference in knowledge between the groups at baseline or immediately after teaching. Both groups made significant gains in knowledge after teaching. Students who attended the lecture rated their subjective knowledge and skills at a statistically significantly higher level than students who had used the computers. Students who had used the computer package scored higher on an objective measure of assessment skills. Students did not perceive the computer package to be as useful as the traditional lecture format, despite finding it easy to use and recommending its use to other students.

3031150,USA/Canada,Middle/High School,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Few evidence-based interventions address adolescent relationship abuse in clinical settings. This cluster randomized controlled trial tested the effectiveness of a brief relationship abuse education and counseling intervention in school health centers (SHCs). METHODS: In 2012-2013, 11 SHCs (10 clusters) were randomized to intervention (SHC providers received training to implement) or standard-of-care control condition. Among 1062 eligible students ages 14 to 19 years at 8 SHCs who continued participation after randomization, 1011 completed computer-assisted surveys before a clinic visit; 939 completed surveys 3 months later (93% retention). RESULTS: Intervention versus control adjusted mean differences (95% confidence interval) on changes in primary outcomes were not statistically significant: recognition of abuse = 0.10 (20.02 to 0.22); intentions to intervene = 0.03 (20.09 to 0.15); and knowledge of resources = 0.18 (20.06 to 0.42). Intervention participants had improved recognition of sexual coercion compared with controls (adjusted mean difference = 0.10 [0.01 to 0.18]). In exploratory analyses adjusting for intensity of intervention uptake, intervention effects were significant for increased knowledge of relationship abuse resources and self-efficacy to use harm reduction behaviors. Among participants reporting relationship abuse at baseline, intervention participants were less likely to report such abuse at follow-up (mean risk difference = 20.17 [20.21 to 20.12]).

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A school-based cluster randomized trial was conducted in Perth, Western Australia in 30 government high schools from 1999 to 2000. Over 4000 students were recruited to participate and schools were assigned randomly to either the harm minimization intervention or a standard abstinence-based programme. INTERVENTION: The harm minimization intervention comprised eight 1-hour lessons over 2 years, quitting support from school nurses and enactment of policies to support programme components. Comparison schools implemented standard abstinence-based programmes and policies. MEASURES: Cigarette smoking was categorized at two levels: regular smoking, defined as smoking on 4 or more days in the previous week; and 30-day smoking as any smoking within the previous month. FINDINGS: At immediate post-test (20 months post-baseline), after accounting for baseline differences, school-level clustering effects, socio-economic status, gender and family smoking, intervention students were less likely to smoke regularly [OR = 0.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.36, 0.71] or to have smoked within the previous 30 days (OR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.53, 0.91).

3031016,Rest of Europe,Middle/High School,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"BACKGROUND: Effective interventions to prevent overweight and obesity in children are urgently needed especially in inner-city neighbourhoods where prevalence of overweight and inactivity among primary school children is high. A school based intervention was developed aiming at the reduction of overweight and inactivity in these children by addressing both behavioural and environmental determinants. METHODS/DESIGN: The main components of the intervention (Lekker Fit!) are the re-establishment of a professional physical education teacher; three (instead of two) PE classes per week; additional sport and play activities outside school hours; fitness testing; classroom education on healthy nutrition, active living and healthy lifestyle choices; and the involvement of parents. The effectiveness of the intervention is evaluated through a cluster randomized controlled trial in 20 primary schools among grades 3 through 8 (6-12 year olds). Primary outcome measures are BMI, waist circumference and fitness. Secondary outcome measures are assessed in a subgroup of grade 6-8 pupils (9-12 year olds) through classroom questionnaires and constitute of nutrition and physical activity behaviours and behavioural determinants. Multilevel regression analyses are used to study differences in outcomes between children in the intervention schools and in control schools, taking clustering of children within schools into account. DISCUSSION: Hypotheses are that the intervention results in a lower prevalence of children being overweight and an improved mean fitness score, in comparison with a control group where the intervention is not implemented. The results of our study will contribute to the discussion on the role of physical education and physical activity in the school curriculum.

DESIGN: Cluster randomized trial with 2.5-year follow-up; prespecified subgroup analyses by sex. SETTING: Grade 9 health classes. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1722 students aged 14-15 from 20 public schools (52.8% girls). Intervention A 21-lesson curriculum delivered during 28 hours by teachers with additional training in the dynamics of dating violence and healthy relationships. Dating violence prevention was integrated with core lessons about healthy relationships, sexual health, and substance use prevention using interactive exercises. Relationship skills to promote safer decision making with peers and dating partners were emphasized. Control schools targeted similar objectives without training or materials. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome at 2.5 years was self-reported PDV during the previous year. Secondary outcomes were physical peer violence, substance use, and condom use. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. RESULTS: The PDV was greater in control vs intervention students (9.8% vs 7.4%; adjusted odds ratio, 2.42; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-6.02; P = .05). A significant group x sex interaction effect indicated that the intervention effect was greater in boys (PDV: 7.1% in controls vs 2.7% in intervention students) than in girls (12.1% vs 11.9%). Main effects for secondary outcomes were not statistically significant; however, sex x group analyses showed a significant difference in condom use in sexually active boys who received the intervention (114 of 168; 67.9%) vs controls (65 of 111 [58.6%]) (P < .01). The cost of training and materials averaged CA$16 per student.

Twenty-nine schools in southern England have been randomized to either peer-led sex education or to continue with their traditional teacher-led sex education. The primary objective is to determine which form of sex education is more effective in promoting young people's sexual health. The trial includes an unusually detailed evaluation of the process of sex education as well as the outcomes. The sex education programs were delivered in school to pupils ages 13-14 years who are being followed until ages 19-20. Major trial outcomes are unprotected sexual intercourse and regretted intercourse by age 16 and cumulative incidence of abortion by ages 19-20.

METHODS: A cluster randomized controlled trial with 14 secondary schools in Hong Kong and a total of 3713 students (intervention: 1545 vs control: 2168; 40.2% boys; mean age +/- SD: 14.72 +/- 1.53 years) were included in the final analysis. The intervention included a town hall seminar, small class workshops, a slogan competition, a brochure, and an educational Web site. Their parents and teachers were offered sleep education seminars. The control schools did not receive any sleep program. Data were collected before and 5 weeks after the intervention. RESULTS: The students in the intervention group had significantly improved sleep knowledge compared with the control group (mean difference: 3.64 [95% confidence interval (CI): 3.21 to 4.07]; Cohen's d = 0.51) as measured by using a sleep knowledge questionnaire.

3030750,Asia,Middle/High School,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"Background: Since September 2000 Israeli children have been exposed to a large number of terrorist attacks. A universal, school-based intervention for dealing with the threat of terrorism as well as with terror-related symptoms, ERASE-Stress (ES), was evaluated in a male religious middle school in southern Israel. The program was administered by the homeroom teachers as part of the school curriculum. It consists of 12 classroom sessions each lasting 90 minutes, and included psycho-educational material, skill training and resiliency strategies delivered to the students by homeroom teachers. Methods: One hundred and fourteen 7th and 8th grade students were randomly assigned to the ES intervention or were part of a waiting list (WL). They were assessed on measures of posttraumatic symptomatology, depression, somatic symptoms and functional problems before and 3 months after the intervention or the WL period. Results: Three months after the program ended, students in the experimental group showed significant reduction in all measures compared to the waiting-list control group. Conclusions: The ERASE-Stress program may help students suffering from terror-related posttraumatic symptoms and mitigate the negative effects of future traumatic experiences. Furthermore, a school-based universal program such as the ERASE-Stress may potentially serve as an important and effective component of a community mental health policy for communities affected by terrorism.","A School-Based, Teacher-Mediated Prevention Program (Erase-Stress) for Reducing Terror-Related Traumatic Reactions in Israeli Youth: A Quasi-Randomized Controlled Trial","https://www.google.com/search?q=A+School-Based,+Teacher-Mediated+Prevention+Program+(Erase-Stress)+for+Reducing+Terror-Related+Traumatic+Reactions+in+Israeli+Youth:+A+Quasi-Randomized+Controlled+Trial",2008,Universal,Regular Teachers/Lecturers,Up to Half a Term,None,None,Single,114,NA,Yes,Whole Sample Only,At Least Some Follow-Up,Yes,No,No,No,Asia Middle/High School Physical Health and Wellbeing

Method: This study employed a school-randomized, experimental design and included 942 3rd-grade children (49% boys; 45.6% Hispanic/Latino, 41.1% Black/African American, 4.7% non-Hispanic White, and 8.6% other racial/ethnic groups, including Asian, Pacific Islander, Native American) in 18 New York City public elementary schools. Data on children's social-cognitive processes (e.g., hostile attribution biases), behavioral symptomatology (e.g., conduct problems), and literacy skills and academic achievement (e.g., reading achievement) were collected in the fall and spring of 1 school year. Results: There were main effects of the 4Rs Program after 1 year on only 2 of the 13 outcomes examined. These include children's self-reports of hostile attributional biases (Cohen's d = 0.20) and depression (d = 0.24). As expected based on program and developmental theory, there were impacts of the intervention for those children identified by teachers at baseline with the highest levels of aggression (d = 0.32-0.59) on 4 other outcomes: children's self-reports of aggressive fantasies, teacher reports of academic skills, reading achievement scaled scores, and children's attendance. Conclusions: This report of effects of the 4Rs intervention on individual children across domains of functioning after 1 school year represents an important first step in establishing a better understanding of what is achievable by a schoolwide intervention such as the 4Rs in its earliest stages of unfolding. The first-year impacts, combined with our knowledge of sustained and expanded effects after a second year, provide evidence that this intervention may be initiating positive developmental cascades both in the general population of students and among those at highest behavioral risk.

3031626,USA/Canada,College/University,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"BACKGROUND: Online social networks, such as Facebook?, have extensive reach, and they use technology that could enhance social support, an established determinant of physical activity. This combination of reach and functionality makes online social networks a promising intervention platform for increasing physical activity. PURPOSE: To test the efficacy of a physical activity intervention that combined education, physical activity monitoring, and online social networking to increase social support for physical activity compared to an education-only control. DESIGN: RCT. Students (n=134) were randomized to two groups: education-only controls receiving access to a physical activity-focused website (n=67) and intervention participants receiving access to the same website with physical activity self-monitoring and enrollment in a Facebook group (n=67). Recruitment and data collection occurred in 2010 and 2011; data analyses were performed in 2011. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Female undergraduate students at a large southeastern public university. INTERVENTION: Intervention participants were encouraged through e-mails, website instructions, and moderator communications to solicit and provide social support related to increasing physical activity through a physical activity-themed Facebook group. Participants received access to a dedicated website with educational materials and a physical activity self-monitoring tool. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was perceived social support for physical activity; secondary outcomes included self-reported physical activity. RESULTS: Participants experienced increases in social support and physical activity over time but there were no differences in perceived social support or physical activity between groups over time. Facebook participants posted 259 times to the group. Two thirds (66%) of intervention participants completing a post-study survey indicated that they would recommend the program to friends. CONCLUSIONS: Use of an online social networking group plus self-monitoring did not produce greater perceptions of social support or physical activity as compared to education-only controls. Given their promising features and potential reach, efforts to further understand how online social networks can be used in health promotion should be pursued.

Method: In a 2-site randomized controlled trial, 199 children (ages 7-11 years) were randomized to CLAS (N = 74), parent-focused treatment (PFT, N = 74), or treatment as usual (TAU, N = 51). We compared groups on parent and teacher ratings of inattention symptoms, organizational skills, social skills, and global improvement at posttreatment and also at follow-up during the subsequent school year. Results: CLAS resulted in greater improvements in teacher-reported inattention, organizational skills, social skills, and global functioning relative to both PFT and TAU at posttreatment. Parents of children in CLAS reported greater improvement in organizational skills than PFT and greater improvements on all outcomes relative to TAU at posttreatment. Differences between CLAS and TAU were maintained at follow-up for most parent-reported measures but were not significant for teacherreported outcomes. Conclusions: These findings extend support for CLAS across 2 study sites, revealing that integrating parent, teacher, and child treatment components, specifically adapted for ADHD-I, is superior to parent training alone and to usual care.

8154261,Australia/New Zealand,College/University,Professional Training,"Background: In the interests of patient health outcomes, it is important for medical students to develop clinical communication
skills. We previously proposed a telehealth communication skills training platform (EQClinic) with automated nonverbal behavior
feedback for medical students, and it was able to improve medical students’ awareness of their nonverbal communication.
Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of EQClinic to improve clinical communication skills of medical
students.
Methods: We conducted a 2-group randomized crossover trial between February and June 2016. Participants were second-year
medical students enrolled in a clinical communication skills course at an Australian university. Students were randomly allocated
to complete online EQClinic training during weeks 1–5 (group A) or to complete EQClinic training during weeks 8–11 (group
B). EQClinic delivered an automated visual presentation of students’ nonverbal behavior coupled with human feedback from a
standardized patient (SP). All students were offered two opportunities to complete face-to-face consultations with SPs. The two
face-to-face consultations were conducted in weeks 6–7 and 12–13 for both groups, and were rated by tutors who were blinded
to group allocation. Student-Patient Observed Communication Assessment (SOCA) was collected by blinded assessors (n=28)
at 2 time points and also by an SP (n=83). Tutor-rated clinical communications skill in face-to-face consultations was the primary
outcome and was assessed with the SOCA. We used t tests to examine the students’ performance during face-to-face consultations
pre- and postexposure to EQClinic.
Results: We randomly allocated 268 medical students to the 2 groups (group A: n=133; group B: n=135). SOCA communication
skills measures (score range 4–16) from the first face-to-face consultation were significantly higher for students in group A who
had completed EQClinic training and reviewed the nonverbal behavior feedback, compared with group B, who had completed
only the course curriculum components (P=.04). Furthermore, at the second face-to-face assessment, the group that completed a
teleconsultation between the two face-to-face consultations (group B) showed improved communication skills (P=.005), and the
one that had teleconsultations before the first face-to-face consultation (group A) did not show improvement. Conclusions: The EQClinic is a useful tool for medical students’ clinical communication skills training that can be applied to
university settings to improve students clinical communication skills development.","A Web-Based Telehealth Training Platform Incorporating

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of abstinence and safer-sex HIV risk-reduction interventions on young inner-city African American adolescents' HIV sexual risk behaviors when implemented by adult facilitators as compared with peer cofacilitators. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial with 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up. SETTING: Three middle schools serving low-income African American communities in Philadelphia, Pa. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 659 African American adolescents recruited for a Saturday program. INTERVENTIONS: Based on cognitive-behavioral theories and elicitation research, interventions involved 8 1-hour modules implemented by adult facilitators or peer cofacilitators. Abstinence intervention stressed delaying sexual intercourse or reducing its frequency; safer-sex intervention stressed condom use; control intervention concerned health issues unrelated to sexual behavior. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported sexual intercourse, condom use, and unprotected sexual intercourse. RESULTS: Mean age of the enrollees was 11.8 years; 53% were female and 92.6% were still enrolled at 12 months. Abstinence intervention participants were less likely to report having sexual intercourse in the 3 months after intervention than were control group participants (12.5% vs 21.5%, P=.02), but not at 6- or 12-month follow-up (17.2% vs 22.7%, P=.14; 20.0% vs 23.1%, P=.42, respectively).

Among adolescents who reported sexual experience at baseline, the safer-sex intervention group reported less sexual intercourse in the previous 3 months at 6- and 12-month follow-up than did control and abstinence intervention (adjusted mean days over prior 3 months, 1.34 vs 3.77 and 3.03, respectively; P< or =.01 at 12- month follow-up) and less unprotected intercourse at all follow-ups than did control group (adjusted mean days, 0.04 vs 1.85, respectively, P<.001, at 12-month follow-up). There were no differences in intervention effects with adult facilitators as compared with peer cofacilitators.

8154989,Australia/New Zealand,Primary/Elementary,Literacy/English,"IMPORTANCE Working memory trainingmay help children with attention and learning difficulties, but robust evidence from population-level randomized controlled clinical trials is lacking. OBJECTIVE To test whether a computerized adaptive working memory intervention program improves long-term academic outcomes of children 6 to 7 years of age with low working memory compared with usual classroom teaching. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Population-based randomized controlled clinical trial of first graders from 44 schools in Melbourne, Australia, who underwent a verbal and visuospatial working memory screening. Children were classified as having low working memory if their scores were below the 15th percentile on either the Backward Digit Recall or Mister X subtest from the AutomatedWorking Memory Assessment, or if their scores were below the 25th percentile on both. These children were randomly assigned by an independent statistician to either an intervention or a control arm using a concealed computerized random number sequence. Researchers were blinded to group assignment at time of screening.We conducted our trial from March 1, 2012, to February 1, 2015; our final analysis was on October 30, 2015.We used intention-to-treat analyses. INTERVENTION Cogmed working memory training, comprising 20 to 25 training sessions of 45 minutes' duration at school. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Directly assessed (at 12 and 24 months) academic outcomes (reading, math, and spelling scores as primary outcomes) and working memory (also assessed at 6 months); parent-, teacher-, and child-reported behavioral and social-emotional functioning and quality of life; and intervention costs. RESULTS Of 1723 children screened (mean [SD] age, 6.9 [0.4] years), 226 were randomized to each arm (452 total), with 90% retention at 1 year and 88%retention at 2 years; 90.3%of children in the intervention arm completed at least 20 sessions. Of the 4 short-term and working memory outcomes, 1 outcome (visuospatial short-term memory) benefited the children at 6 months (effect size, 0.43 [95%CI, 0.25-0.62]) and 12 months (effect size, 0.49 [95%CI, 0.28-0.70]), but not at 24 months. There were no benefits to any other outcomes; in fact, the math scores of the children in the intervention arm were worse at 2 years (mean difference, -3.0 [95%CI, -5.4 to -0.7]; P = .01). Intervention costs were A$1035 per child. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Working memory screening of children 6 to 7 years of age is feasible, and an adaptive working memory training program may temporarily improve visuospatial short-term memory. Given the loss of classroom time, cost, and lack of lasting benefit, we cannot recommend population-based delivery of Cogmed within a screening paradigm.

5132566,UK/Ireland,Middle/High School,Literacy/English,"This paper describes an evaluation of an internet-based reading programme called Accelerated Reader (AR), which is widely used in UK schools and worldwide. AR is a whole-group reading management and monitoring programme that aims to stimulate the habit of independent reading among primary and secondary age pupils. The evaluation involved 349 pupils in Year 7 who had not achieved secure National Curriculum Level 4 in their Key Stage 2 results for English, randomised to two groups. The intervention group of 166 pupils was exposed to AR for 20 weeks, after which they recorded higher literacy scores in the New Group Reading Test (NGRT) post-test than the control group of 183 pupils (“effect” size of +0.24). The schools led the organisation and implementation of the intervention, and also conducted most elements of the evaluation, with advice from an expert external evaluation team. The process evaluation suggests that these schools were very capable of conducting evaluations of their own practice, given appropriate guidance.

3031712,Rest of Europe,College/University,Professional Training,"BACKGROUND: Technology-enhanced learning (TEL) gives a view to improved education. However, there is a need to clarify how TEL can be used effectively. The study compared students' attitudes and opinions towards a traditional face-to-face course on theoretical radiological science and a TEL course where students could combine face-to-face lectures and e-learning modules at their best convenience. METHODS: 42 third-year dental students were randomly assigned to the traditional face-to-face group and the TEL group. Both groups completed questionnaires before the beginning and after completion of the course on attitudes and opinions towards a traditional face-to-face lectures and technology-enhanced learning. After completion of the course both groups also filled in the validated German-language TRIL (Trierer Inventar zur Lehrevaluation) questionnaire for the evaluation of courses given at universities. RESULTS: Both groups had a positive attitude towards e-learning that did not change over time. The TEL group attended significantly less face-to-face lectures than the traditional group. However, both groups stated that face-to-face lectures were the basis for education in a theoretical radiological science course. The members of the TEL group rated e-mail reminders significantly more important when they filled in the questionnaire on attitudes and opinions towards a traditional face-to-face lectures and technology-enhanced learning for the second time after completion of the course. The members of the technology-enhanced learning group were significantly less confident in passing the exam compared to the members of the traditional group. However, examination results did not differ significantly for traditional and the TEL group. CONCLUSIONS: It seems that technology-enhanced learning in a theoretical radiological science course has the potential to reduce the need for face-to-face lectures. At the same time examination results are not impaired. However, technology-enhanced learning cannot completely replace traditional face-to-face lectures, because students indicate that they consider traditional teaching as the basis of their education.",Acceptance of technology-enhanced learning for a theoretical radiological science course: a randomized controlled trial,https://www.google.com/search?q=Acceptance+of+technology-enhanced+learning+for+a+theoretical+radiological+science+course:+a+randomized+controlled+trial,2012,Universal,Regular Teachers/Lecturers,Up to Half a Term,None,None,Single,42,NA,No,Whole Sample Only,Immediate Post-Test Only,Yes,No,"Yes, Descriptive Theory of Change",Yes,Rest of Europe College/University Professional Training
3031302,USA/Canada,College/University,Professional Training,"PURPOSE: Spaced education is a novel form of online education that harnesses the 2 psychology research findings of spacing and testing effects. Spaced education is delivered by daily emails containing clinically relevant multiple choice questions. To take advantage of the spacing effect the questions are repeated at fixed intervals for a fixed number of repetitions. An adaptive spaced education system was developed to customize spacing intervals and the number of repetitions based on learner knowledge level. To determine whether this system improves learning efficiency I performed a randomized trial to compare the learning efficiency of adaptive vs nonadaptive spaced education systems among surgery students at 2 medical schools. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 62 year 3 students were randomized to identical course content in adaptive or nonadaptive spaced education formats. The course consisted of 40 validated, spaced education items on the 4 urology topics benign prostatic hyperplasia, erectile dysfunction, prostate cancer and prostate specific antigen screening. The nonadaptive cohort received daily emails containing 2 questions with a linear review of the material 20 days after initial presentation. The adaptive cohort received daily emails via an adaptive algorithm that limited the repetition of mastered content. Each cohort completed a validated end of course test. RESULTS: The adaptive cohort answered significantly fewer spaced education items than the nonadaptive cohort (p = 0.001) but achieved comparable end of course test scores (p = 0.37). The adaptive algorithm increased learning efficiency by 38%.

3031437,Africa,Middle/High School,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"Context:Cost-effective, scalable programs are urgently needed in countries deeply affected by HIV.Methods:This parallel-group RCT was conducted in four secondary schools in Mbarara, Uganda. Participants were 12 years and older, reported past-year computer or Internet use, and provided informed caregiver permission and youth assent. The intervention, CyberSenga, was a five-hour online healthy sexuality program. Half of the intervention group was further randomized to receive a booster at four-months post-intervention. The control arm received 'treatment as usual' (i.e., school-delivered sexuality programming). The main outcome measures were: 1) condom use and 2) abstinence in the past three months at six-months' post-intervention. Secondary outcomes were: 1) condom use and 2) abstinence at three-month's post-intervention; and 6-month outcomes by booster exposure. Analyses were intention to treat.Results:All 416 eligible youth were invited to participate, 88% (n = 366) of whom enrolled. Participants were randomized to the intervention (n = 183) or control (n = 183) arm; 91 intervention participants were further randomized to the booster. No statistically significant results were noted among the main outcomes. Among the secondary outcomes: At three-month follow-up, trends suggested that intervention participants (81%) were more likely to be abstinent than control participants (74%; p = 0.08), and this was particularly true among youth who were abstinent at baseline (88% vs. 77%; p = 0.02). At six-month follow-up, those in the booster group (80%) reported higher rates of abstinence than youth in the intervention, no booster (57%) and control (55%) groups (p = 0.15); they also reported lower rates of unprotected sex (5%) compared to youth in the intervention, no booster (24%) and control (21%) groups (p = 0.21) among youth sexually active at baseline.Conclusions:The CyberSenga program may affect HIV preventive behavior among abstinent youth in the short term and, with the booster, may also promote HIV preventive behavior among sexually active youth in the longer term.Trial Registration: NCT00906178. 2013 Ybarra et al.","Adolescent Abstinence and Unprotected Sex in CyberSenga, an Internet-Based HIV Prevention Program: Randomized Clinical Trial of Efficacy","https://www.google.com/search?q=Adolescent+Abstinence+and+Unprotected+Sex+in+CyberSenga,+an+Internet-Based+HIV+Prevention+Program:+Randomized+Clinical+Trial+of+Efficacy",2013,Universal,External Educators,Up to Half a Term,Behaviour and Social Wellbeing,None,Single,366,NA,Yes,Some Sub-Groups Reported,At Least Some Follow-Up,Yes,"Yes, Limited","Yes, Descriptive Theory of Change",Yes,Africa Middle/High School Physical Health and Wellbeing

3031204,Central/South America,Middle/High School,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of an abstinence-centered sex education program in adolescent pregnancy prevention, the TeenSTAR Program was applied in a high school in Santiago, Chile. METHODS: A total of 1259 girls from a Santiago high school were divided into three cohorts depending on the year they started high school: the 1996 cohort of 425 students, which received no intervention; the 1997 cohort, in which 210 students received an intervention and 213 (control group) did not; and the 1998 cohort, in which 328 students received an intervention and 83 (control group) did not. Students were randomly assigned to control and intervention groups in these cohorts, before starting with the program. We conducted a prospective, randomized study using the application of the TeenSTAR sex education program during the first year of high school to the intervention groups in the 1997 and 1998 cohorts. All cohorts were followed up for 4 years; pregnancy rates were recorded and subsequently contrasted in the intervention and control groups. Pregnancy rates were measured and Risk Ratio with 95% confidence interval were calculated for intervention and control groups in each cohort. RESULTS: Pregnancy rates for the intervention and control groups in the 1997 cohort were 3.3% and 18.9%, respectively (RR: 0.176, CI: 0.076-0.408).

3031792,NA,NA,NA,"A cluster randomised trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of a health promotion intervention aimed at improving knowledge and preventing sexually transmitted diseases (STD) amongst Grade 9 primary school students in Salerno (Italy). Students were randomized to either one of two groups: intervention group or control group. The intervention group was required to attend three meetings, each lasting one and a half hours. A questionnaire was then administered to both groups to evaluate knowledge of STD, contraception, sexuality, affectivity, satisfaction with interpersonal relationships with family, social groups and healthcare professionals. Variations of knowledge in the two groups were evaluated through calculation of odds ratios. Three hundred twenty-two students participated in the study. All students who received the study intervention were able to identify at least one STD post-intervention, while 2.5% of students in the control group did not indicate any. Students in the intervention group were more likely to select condoms as the most suitable contraception for young people (OR 5.54; 95% CI 3.27 -9.38), compared to controls (OR 1.91; 95% CI 1.20 - 3.05) (p = 0.002).

Two coders, blinded to student assignments, independently coded these data. Coders had strong inter-rater agreement (kappa = 0.77). Our primary measures were spontaneously noted overall assessment, enjoyment/interest and the likelihood of changing smoking behavior.

3030769,Rest of Europe,College/University,Professional Training,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Owing to the complex topographical aspects of ophthalmic surgery, teaching with conventional surgical videos has led to a poor understanding among medical students. A novel multimedia three dimensional (3D) computer animated program, called 'Ophthalmic Operation Vienna' has been developed, where surgical videos are accompanied by 3D animated sequences of all surgical steps for five operations. The aim of the study was to assess the effect of 3D animations on the understanding of cataract and glaucoma surgery among medical students. METHOD: Set in the Medical University of Vienna, Department of Ophthalmology, 172 students were randomised into two groups: a 3D group (n=90), that saw the 3D animations and video sequences, and a control group (n=82), that saw only the surgical videos. The narrated text was identical for both groups. After the presentation, students were questioned and tested using multiple choice questions. RESULTS: Students in the 3D group found the interactive multimedia teaching methods to be a valuable supplement to the conventional surgical videos. The 3D group outperformed the control group not only in topographical understanding by 16% (p<0.0001), but also in theoretical understanding by 7% (p<0.003). Women in the 3D group gained most by 19% over the control group (p<0.0001).

Design: A Phase I two-group single-blinded randomised controlled trial with a 1:1 allocation ratio. Method: Eligible to participate were 8-18 year olds attending one of three metropolitan specialist schools, with a diagnosis of cerebral palsy, GMFCS I-III, and a reliable yes/no response. Exclusion criteria were surgery or botulinum toxin- A to the lower-limbs, or aerobic training, in the previous 6 months. Recruitment was through the physiotherapy departments of the participating schools. Participants were randomised to either the intervention or control group. The intervention group completed a 9-week supervised group aerobic training programme, three times weekly for 30 minutes during their lunch break. The supervision ratio was either 1:1 or 1:2. The programmes were individualised, and considered student activity preferences. The control group completed an arts programme for the same time and duration. The primary outcomes were feasibility and safety. Feasibility included programme attendance and adherence to training heart rate targets, measured by heart rate monitors that were worn each session. Adverse safety events were recorded as serious or non-serious, expected or unexpected, and related or unrelated to the study. Secondary outcomes measured cardiovascular function and physical activity (6min walk test, Muscle Power Sprint Test, RT3 activity monitors). Results: Nineteen children, with a mean age of 13 year 10 months (GMFCS I n=4; GMFCS II n=9; GMFCS III n=6) took part. Two-hundred and six exercise sessions were attended with no serious adverse events. There were three non-serious adverse events, in two participants, which were expected and related to the intervention. One participant hit her leg on her bike, resulting in some redness that was treated with ice. Another participant tripped over on two separate instances, with no adverse consequences. Participants attended an average of 79% sessions; across the intervention there was 80% adherence to target heart rate. There were no betweengroup cardiovascular changes, though moderate effect sizes favouring the intervention group were found. Conclusion: This Phase I trial provided initial evidence that young people with high support needs can successfully participate in a school-based aerobic training programme.

Method: This randomized, controlled pilot trial evaluated single-session interventions: Alcohol Skills Training Program (ASTP), Brief Alcohol Screening and Intervention for College Students (BASICS) feedback sessions, and treatment-as-usual Alcohol Diversion Program (ADP) educational groups. Participants were 61 full-time undergraduates at a southern U.S. campus sanctioned to a clinical program following violation of an on-campus alcohol policy (Mage = 19.16 years; 42.6% female). Results: Results revealed a significant effect of time for reductions in estimated blood alcohol concentration (eBAC) and number of weekly drinks but not in alcohol-related consequences. Although ASTP and BASICS participants reported signifi cant decreases in eBAC over time, ADP participant levels did not change (with no intervention effects on quantity or consequences). MI microskills were not related to outcomes. Conclusions: Results from this study suggest equivalent behavioral impacts for the MI-based interventions, although individual differences in outcome trajectories suggest that research is needed to further customize mandated interventions. Given the overall decrease in eBAC following the sanction, the lack of reduction in the ADP condition warrants caution when using education-only interventions.

Cooperative learning theory is one of the most effective theories that is applied in Algebra I classrooms. Cooperative learning gives students the opportunity to work in mixed-ability groups to help each other learn. In addition, students in cooperative learning groups work together to achieve a common goal. The researcher implemented a mixed-methodology design that included quantitative and qualitative instruments. The researcher drew the research sample of 54 students from three high school Algebra I classes. The experimental groups and control group consisted each of 18 students. The experimental groups learned using think-pair-share and jigsaw cooperative learning strategies, whereas the control group learned using the traditional teaching method. One mathematics teacher taught all of the groups. The research instruments included a pre-/post benchmark assessment, a post attitudinal survey, a classroom observation tool form, and a teacher interview questionnaire. The interview and classroom observations were used to document the teacher's perceptions about using the think-pair-share and jigsaw cooperative strategies in Algebra I classroom and the classroom behaviors associated with the implementation of strategies. The pre-/post benchmark assessment was used to determine if the think-pair-share and jigsaw cooperative learning strategies had an effect on ninth-grade students' achievement in Algebra I. The post attitudinal survey was used to determine the impact of the think-pair-share and jigsaw cooperative learning strategies on students' attitude toward Algebra I. There was a statistically significant difference between the think-pair-share cooperative learning group and the traditional teaching group. Also, a statistically significant difference was found between the jigsaw cooperative learning group and the control group.

5132914,UK/Ireland,Middle/High School,Literacy/English,"This paper describes a randomised controlled trial conducted with 10 secondary schools in England to evaluate the impact and feasibility of Fresh Start as an intervention to help new entrants with low prior literacy. Fresh Start is a synthetic phonics programme for small groups of pupils, here implemented three times per week over 22 weeks. The intervention was led by the schools themselves and assessed in cooperation with the independent evaluators. A group of 433 year 7 pupils (first year of secondary school) were identified by schools as having literacy attainment below “secure” KS2 level 4, and individually randomised to a treatment group or a waiting-list control. The pupils were assessed via GL’s New Group Reading Test. Missing data at pre- and post-test amounted to 3% of the total. The overall “effect” size in terms of gain scores from pre- to post-test was +0.24, and this was repeated in a sub-group analysis involving only FSM-eligible pupils. However, there was some imbalance between the two groups at the outset, and this must lead to a slight caution about the findings, and to some doubts about whether one or more schools unwittingly subverted the randomisation. Other than this, the aggregated trial shows that schools can conduct evaluations of their own interventions with firm guidance from experts, and under favourable conditions such as individual randomisation and lack of extended involvement by developers with a conflict of interests.

3031532,USA/Canada,Middle/High School,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"BACKGROUND: There are few effective smoking cessation interventions for adolescent smokers. We developed a novel intervention to motivate tobacco use behavior change by (1) enhancing desire to quit through the use of abstinence-contingent incentives (CM), (2) increasing cessation skills through the use of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and (3) removing cessation barriers through delivery within high schools. METHODS: An exploratory four-week, randomized controlled trial was conducted in Connecticut high schools to dismantle the independent and combined effects of CM and CBT; smokers received CM alone, CBT alone, or CM+CBT. Participants included 82 adolescent smokers seeking smoking cessation treatment. The primary outcome was seven-day end-of-treatment (EOT) point prevalence (PP) abstinence, determined using self-reports confirmed using urine cotinine levels. Secondary outcomes included one-day EOT PP abstinence and cigarette use during treatment and follow up. RESULTS: Among participants who initiated treatment (n=72), group differences in seven-day EOT-PP abstinence were observed (?(2)=10.48, p<0.01) with higher abstinence in the CM+CBT (36.7%) and CM (36.3%) conditions when compared with CBT (0%). One-day EOT-PP abstinence evidenced similar effects (?(2)=10.39, p<0.01; CM+CBT: 43%, CM: 43%, CBT: 4.3%). Survival analyses indicated differences in time to first cigarette during treatment (?(2)=8.73, p=0.003; CBT: Day 3, CM: Day 9, CM+CBT: Day 20). At one- and three-month follow ups, while no differences were observed, the CM alone group had the slowest increase in cigarette use.

3031763,UK/Ireland,Middle/High School,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"Background: Schools in many countries undertake programmes for smoking prevention, but systematic reviews have shown mixed evidence of their effectiveness. Most peer-led approaches have been classroom-based, and rigorous assessments are scarce. We assessed the effectiveness of a peer-led intervention that aimed to prevent smoking uptake in secondary schools. Methods: We undertook a cluster randomised controlled trial of 10 730 students aged 12-13 years in 59 schools in England and Wales. 29 schools (5372 students) were randomly assigned by stratified block randomisation to the control group to continue their usual smoking education and 30 (5358 students) to the intervention group. The intervention (ASSIST [A Stop Smoking In Schools Trial] programme) consisted of training influential students to act as peer supporters during informal interactions outside the classroom to encourage their peers not to smoke. Follow-up was immediately after the intervention and at 1 and 2 years. Primary outcomes were smoking in the past week in both the school year group and in a group at high risk of regular smoking uptake, which was identified at baseline as occasional, experimental, or ex-smokers. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered, number ISRCTN55572965. Findings: The odds ratio of being a smoker in intervention compared with control schools was 0.75 (95% CI 0.55-1.01) immediately after the intervention (n = 9349 students), 0.77 (0.59-0.99) at 1-year follow-up (n = 9147), and 0.85 (0.72-1.01) at 2-year follow-up (n = 8756). The corresponding odds ratios for the high-risk group were 0.79 (0.55-1.13 [n = 3561]), 0.75 (0.56-0.99 [n = 3483]), and 0.85 (0.70-1.02 [n = 3294]), respectively. In a three-tier multilevel model with data from all three follow-ups, the odds of being a smoker in intervention compared with control schools was 0.78 (0.64-0.96). Interpretation: The results suggest that, if implemented on a population basis, the ASSIST intervention could lead to a reduction in adolescent smoking prevalence of public-health importance.

This study determined if an ecologic physical activity intervention in preschools increases children's moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA). Design RCT, with preschool as the unit of randomization and analysis. Child physical activity was measured by accelerometry. Mixed model analysis of covariance with preschool as a random variable was used to test the effects of the intervention on physical activity in the total group and in sex-specific subgroups. Data were collected in 2008-2010 and analyzed in 2012-2014. Setting/participants Children in 4-year-olds' classrooms in 16 preschools, pair matched and assigned to intervention or control groups. Intervention The intervention focused on increasing children's physical activity by changing instructional practices. Researchers trained preschool teachers to engage children in physical activity during (1) structured, teacher-led physical activity opportunities in the classroom; (2) structured and unstructured physical activity opportunities at recess; and (3) physical activity integrated into pre-academic lessons. Research staff encouraged teachers to adapt the intervention to their classrooms. Main outcome measures Minutes/hour of MVPA during the preschool day. Results In an analytic sample of 379 children (188 intervention, 191 control), those in the intervention schools engaged in significantly more MVPA than children in control schools (7.4 and 6.6 minutes/hour, respectively). This difference remained significant after adjusting for parent education and length of the school day (half versus full day). In the sex-specific analyses, the difference was significant for girls (6.8 vs 6.1 minutes/hour of MVPA, respectively) but not for boys (7.9 vs 7.2 minutes/hour, respectively).

School-based programmes promoting healthy lifestyles are lacking. The purpose of this study was to develop, implement and evaluate the effectiveness of a multicomponent school-based intervention to promote healthy eating and physical activity and prevent obesity, with school children aged 9-11 years in Lebanon. Methods: The intervention was developed based on the constructs of the Social Cognitive Theory and adapted to the culture of Arab populations. It consisted of three components: class curriculum, family involvement and food service. Eight schools were purposively selected from two dif ferent communities in Beirut and were randomly assigned to either the intervention or control group. Anthropometric measurements were taken, and questionnaires on determinants of behavioural change, eating and physical activity habits were completed by the students in both groups at baseline and post intervention. Focus group interviews were conducted in intervention schools at the end of the study. Results: Students in the intervention group reported purchasing and consuming less chips and sweetened drinks post-intervention compared with controls (86% & 88% less respectively p<0.001). Knowledge and self-efficacy scores doubled only for the intervention group at post-test. No differences in physical activity or screen time habits were observed in either group. Focus groups interviews showed that the programme was well accepted and viewed as enjoyable. Limitations to better outcomes include the short duration of the intervention and the unchanged school environment.

3031916,USA/Canada,College/University,Professional Training,"Problem: Equipping current and future social work practitioners with skills to deliver evidence-based practice (EBP) has remained an elusive prospect since synchronized efforts with field instructors have not been a consistent part of dissemination and implementation efforts. Recognizing the highly influential position of field instructors, this dissertation presents a study of an innovative teaching model which included the field instructor and social work student dyad. Objective: To examine the effectiveness of an EBP teaching model that sought to enhance attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control and self-efficacy to engage in both the process of EBP as well as designated EBPs among dyads of graduate level field instructors and their social work student interns as compared to dyads in the control condition, who participated in education as usual. Methods: This was a pilot RCT comprised of a convenience sample of 40 dyads (n = 80) of field instructors and their social work interns. The intervention included a preliminary introduction to the process of EBP followed by a 6- hour didactic and experiential training on a designated EBP, Motivational Interviewing (MI). Experimental dyads completed practice audiotapes of new MI skills and searched literature as part of a booster activity. Experimental dyads also received a fidelity report on their audiotapes from an expert MI consultant. Data were collected via Survey Monkey at baseline and at one and 3 months post intervention. Measures included the Evidence Based Practice Process Assessment Scale (EBPPAS) (Parrish and Rubin, 2011) and the Evidence Based Practice Assessment Scale (EBPAS) (Aarons, 2004). It was hypothesized that attitudes toward both the process of EBP as well as toward designated EBPs would improve for experimental dyads compared to control dyads. A repeated measures ANOVA was run in PROC MIXED of the SAS system to examine whether there were significant over time differences between conditions. Results: Groups were not statistically different at baseline and at both follow up time points, experimental dyads had significantly better scores (<0.0001) on both outcome measures. Conclusions: This teaching model holds promise as one means of systematically imparting EBP concepts and competencies to the social work workforce.

Many young students lack the basic vocabulary knowledge needed to facilitate learning to read. Two randomized studies were conducted to test the effects of an online, computer-adaptive vocabulary instruction program designed to provide remedial instruction on word meanings for high frequency words. Study 1 was small in scope (N = 43) and tested whether the program could improve word knowledge on a corpus of 100 target words taught to all students in the treatment group. Study 2 was larger in scope (N = 192) and tested whether more extensive use of the computer-adaptive program, which teaches students individualized sets of words from a 4000 word corpus, could improve vocabulary test scores. Scaling up from 100 words in Study 1 to 4000 words in Study 2 necessarily corresponded to a proportionally equivalent decrease in posttest sensitivity to changes in students' vocabulary knowledge.

This was a pilot randomized controlled trial to investigate the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of an aquatic therapy program to improve motor skills of children with DCD. Thirteen children (mean age 7 years 1 month; 10 males) with DCD were randomly allocated to receive either six sessions of aquatic therapy (once weekly session of 30 min for 6-8 weeks) or to a wait-list (control group). The intervention and measures were demonstrated to be feasible, but barriers, such as limited appointment times and accessibility, were encountered. Analysis of covariance indicated that at posttest, mean scores on the Movement Assessment Battery were higher for children who received aquatic therapy compared to those on the wait-list (p = 0.057). Similar trends were noted on the physical competence portion of the Pictorial Scale of Perceived Competence and Social Acceptance (p = 0.058).

3030994,Australia/New Zealand,Special School,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"BACKGROUND: Adolescents with intellectual disability often have poor health and healthcare. This is partly as a consequence of poor communication and recall difficulties, and the possible loss of specialised paediatric services. METHODS/DESIGN: A cluster randomised trial was conducted with adolescents with intellectual disability to investigate a health intervention package to enhance interactions among adolescents with intellectual disability, their parents/carers, and general practitioners (GPs). The trial took place in Queensland, Australia, between February 2007 and September 2010. The intervention package was designed to improve communication with health professionals and families' organisation of health information, and to increase clinical activities beneficial to improved health outcomes. It consisted of the Comprehensive Health Assessment Program (CHAP), a one-off health check, and the Ask Health Diary, designed for on-going use. Participants were drawn from Special Education Schools and Special Education Units. The education component of the intervention was delivered as part of the school curriculum. Educators were surveyed at baseline and followed-up four months later. Carers were surveyed at baseline and after 26 months. Evidence of health promotion, disease prevention and case-finding activities were extracted from GPs clinical records. Qualitative interviews of educators occurred after completion of the educational component of the intervention and with adolescents and carers after the CHAP. DISCUSSION: Adolescents with intellectual disability have difficulty obtaining many health services and often find it difficult to become empowered to improve and protect their health. The health intervention package proposed may aid them by augmenting communication, improving documentation of health encounters, and improving access to, and quality of, GP care. Recruitment strategies to consider for future studies in this population include ensuring potential participants can identify themselves with the individuals used in promotional study material, making direct contact with their families at the start of the study, and closely monitoring the implementation of the educational intervention.

There is also mixed evidence on the effectiveness of adding implementation intentions to TPB-based interventions. In this study we assessed and compared the short-term effects of TPB-only intervention and TPB plus implementation intentions intervention on snacking behavior and intention to consume unhealthy snacks in Iranian adolescent girls. DESIGN: Three-arm cluster randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Ten middle schools in Tehran (Iran). SUBJECTS: A total of 29 classes included 739 female adolescents (age range: 12-15 years). Intervention. Two brief interventions including TPB-only intervention and TPB plus implementation intentions intervention. MEASURES: Food frequency questionnaire and intentions at baseline, 10 days, and 3 months measuring snacking behavior and cognitions about unhealthy snack consumption, respectively. ANALYSIS: Hierarchical linear modeling to assess the interventions' effects. RESULTS: Both interventions successfully decreased intention to consume and consumption of unhealthy snacks at postintervention. Calculation of the effect sizes revealed that the TPB plus implementation intentions intervention was more effective than the TPB-only intervention. The effects remained significant at 3-month follow-up in the TPB plus implementation intentions intervention group only, although the effect size decreased.

8155282,NA,NA,NA,"The powerful role teachers have on students??ï¿½ learning and academic performance has been well established in the empirical literature. However, researchers have not been successful in explaining what exactly it is about teachers that foster students??ï¿½ academic success in the classroom. The premise of this dissertation was that teachers who provide affirming, supportive, and organized interactions, also known as teacher interactional quality, have beneficial effects on students??ï¿½ academic achievement. This dissertation used the largest education dataset of United States students, known as the Measures of Effective Teaching (MET), to examine the association of teacher interactional quality on classroom achievement. The MET dataset incorporated random assignment in the placement of teachers to classrooms of students and collected multiple measures of teacher quality. This investigation contributed to the existing body of research on teacher quality by examining the associations between teacher interactional quality in fourth and fifth grade classrooms and achievement outcomes. In addition, the distribution of teacher interactional quality across classrooms with different percentages of free or reduced lunch receipt was examined. Findings indicated that teacher interactional quality and free or reduced lunch percentage were associated with English/language art classroom achievement outcomes when teachers went about their everyday practices in the classroom and when teachers were randomized to classrooms of students. Teacher interactional quality was associated with math classroom achievement outcomes only during the business-as-usual year when teachers went about their usual teaching practices in the classroom. Furthermore, teacher interactional quality impact on English/language art classroom achievement outcomes changed based on the proportion of free or reduced lunch in the classroom during the business-as-usual year but not during the year when teachers were randomly assigned to classrooms of students. Recommendations are derived for conducting longitudinal follow-ups with students who have been exposed to certain levels of interactional quality, examining the experiences of students from different socioeconomic backgrounds and ethnicities, and pursuing the distinction between classrooms with and without typical random assignment of teachers. Teacher preparation programs have the ability to identify desirable teacher dispositions and positive interactional styles early on in the program through multiple observations and reflective opportunities. If preparation programs are able to better identify teacher qualities that have an impact on student learning, this information can be used to attract, prepare, support, and retain teachers who are skilled in their interactions and emotionally attuned to the needs of students. This information can be used as a foundation for states and districts as they develop mentoring, coaching, professional development, and teacher evaluation systems for strengthening the recruitment and retention of high quality teachers.",Associations between teacher interactional quality and student achievement: A classroom-level analysis of randomized and non-randomized teacher assignments in the measure of effective teaching project,https://www.google.com/search?q=Associations+between+teacher+interactional+quality+and+student+achievement:+A+classroom-level+analysis+of+randomized+and+non-randomized+teacher+assignments+in+the+measure+of+effective+teaching+project,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA NA NA
3031282,UK/Ireland,College/University,Behaviour and Social Wellbeing,"AIM: This paper reports a study to determine the effectiveness of autogenic training in reducing anxiety in nursing students. BACKGROUND: Nursing is stressful, and nursing students also have the additional pressures and uncertainties shared with all academic students. Autogenic training is a relaxation technique consisting of six mental exercises and is aimed at relieving tension, anger and stress. Meta-analysis has found large effect sizes for autogenic trainings intervention comparisons, medium effect sizes against control groups, and no effects when compared with other psychological therapies. A controlled trial with 50 nursing students found that the number of certified days off sick was reduced by autogenic training compared with no treatment, and a second trial with only 18 students reported greater improvement in Trait Anxiety, but not State Anxiety, compared with untreated controls. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial with three parallel arms was completed in 1998 with 93 nursing students aged 19-49 years. The setting was a university college in the United Kingdom. The treatment group received eight weekly sessions of autogenic training, the attention control group received eight weekly sessions of laughter therapy, and the time control group received no intervention. The outcome measures were the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Maslach Burnout Inventory, blood pressure and pulse rate completed at baseline, 2 months (end of treatment), and 5, 8, and 11 months from randomization. RESULTS: There was a statistically significantly greater reduction of State (P<0.001) and Trait (P<0.001) Anxiety in the autogenic training group than in both other groups immediately after treatment. There were no differences between the groups for the Maslach Burnout Inventory. The autogenic training group also showed statistically significantly greater reduction immediately after treatment in systolic (P<0.01) and diastolic (P<0.05) blood pressure, and pulse rate (P<0.002), than the other two groups.

3030676,UK/Ireland,Primary/Elementary,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"Objectives: To assess the behavioural and weight status outcomes in English children in a feasibility study of a novel primary school-based obesity prevention programme. Design: Exploratory cluster randomised controlled trial of the Healthy Lifestyles Programme. Setting: Four city primary schools (two control and two intervention) in the South West of England. Participants: 202 children aged 9-10 years, of whom 193 and 188 were followed up at 18 and 24 months, respectively. No child was excluded from the study; however, to be eligible, schools were required to have at least one single Year 5 class. Intervention: Four-phase multicomponent programme using a range of school-based activities including lessons, assemblies, parents' evenings, interactive drama workshops and goal setting to engage and support schools, children and their families in healthy lifestyle behaviours. It runs over the spring and summer term of Year 5 and the autumn term of Year 6. Primary and secondary outcomes: Weight status outcomes were body mass index, waist circumference and body fat standard deviation scores (SDS) at 18 and 24 months, and behavioural outcomes were physical activity, television (TV) viewing/screen time and food intake at 18 months. Results: At 18 months of follow-up, intervention children consumed less energy-dense snacks and more healthy snacks; had less 'negative food markers', more 'positive food markers', lower mean TV/screen time and spent more time doing moderate-vigorous physical activity each day than those in the control schools. Intervention children had lower anthropometric measures at 18 and 24 months than control children, with larger differences at 24 months than at 18 months for nearly all measures.

3030991,UK/Ireland,Middle/High School,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of conducting a large randomised controlled trial (RCT) of peer led intervention in schools to reduce the risk of HIV/STD and promote sexual health. METHODS: Four secondary schools in Greater London were randomly assigned to receive peer led intervention (two experimental schools) or to act as control schools. In the experimental schools, trained volunteers aged 16-17 years (year 12) delivered the peer led intervention to 13-14 year old pupils (year 9). In the control schools, year 9 pupils received the usual teacher led sex education. Questionnaire data collected from year 9 pupils at baseline included views on the quality of sex education/intervention received, and knowledge and attitudes about HIV/AIDS and other sexual matters. Focus groups were also conducted with peer educators and year 9 pupils. Data on the process of delivering sex education/intervention and on attitudes to the RCT were collected for each of the schools. Analysis focused on the acceptability of a randomised trial to schools, parents, and pupils. RESULTS: Nearly 500 parents were informed about the research and invited to examine the study questionnaire; only nine raised questions and only one pupil was withdrawn from the study. Questionnaire completion rates were around 90% in all schools. At baseline, the majority of year 9 pupils wanted more information about a wide range of sexual matters. Focus group work indicated considerable enthusiasm for peer led education, among peer educators and year 9 pupils. Class discipline was the most frequently noted problem with the delivery of the peer led intervention. CONCLUSION: Evaluation of a peer led behavioural intervention through an RCT can be acceptable to schools, pupils, and parents and is feasible in practice.

3031156,USA/Canada,Primary/Elementary,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"BACKGROUND: Daily maintenance medications are recommended for all children with mild persistent to severe persistent asthma; however, poor adherence to these medications is common. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of school-based provision of inhaled corticosteroids on asthma severity among urban children with mild persistent to severe persistent asthma. DESIGN: Children aged 3 to 7 years with mild persistent to severe persistent asthma were identified at the start of the 2000-2001 and 2001-2002 school years in Rochester. Children were assigned randomly to a school-based care group (daily inhaled corticosteroids provided through the school) or a usual-care group (inhaled corticosteroids not given through school). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Improvement in parent-reported symptom-free days. RESULTS: Of 242 eligible children, 184 were enrolled from 54 urban schools. Data for 180 children were available. Parents of children in the school-based care group had a greater improvement in quality of life compared with parents of children in the usual-care group (change score, 0.63 vs 0.24; P =.047); also, children in the school-based care group vs the usual-care group missed less school because of asthma (mean total days missed, 6.8 vs 8.8; P =.047) and experienced more symptom-free days during the early winter months (mean days per 2-week period, 9.2 vs 7.3; P =.02). A post hoc analysis revealed that all significant findings were produced by differences among children who were not exposed to secondhand smoke. Furthermore, among children not exposed to smoke, those in the school-based care group vs the usual-care group had more symptom-free days overall (11.5 vs 10.5; P =.046), had fewer days needing rescue medications (1.6 vs 2.3; P =.03), and were less likely to have had 3 or more acute visits for asthma (6 [13%] of 47 children vs 17 [31%] of 54 children; P =.03).

3031398,USA/Canada,Middle/High School,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"OBJECTIVE: To test feasibility of yoga within a high school curriculum and evaluate preventive efficacy for psychosocial well-being. METHODS: Grade 11 or 12 students (N = 51) who registered for physical education (PE) were cluster-randomized by class 2:1 yoga:PE-as-usual. A Kripalu-based yoga program of physical postures, breathing exercises, relaxation, and meditation was taught 2 to 3 times a week for 10 weeks. Self-report questionnaires were administered to students 1 week before and after. Primary outcome measures of psychosocial well-being were Profile of Mood States-Short Form and Positive and Negative Affect Schedule for Children. Additional measures of psychosocial well-being included Perceived Stress Scale and Inventory of Positive Psychological Attitudes. Secondary measures of self-regulatory skills included Resilience Scale, State Trait Anger Expression Inventory-2?, and Child Acceptance Mindfulness Measure. To assess feasibility, yoga students completed a program evaluation. Analyses of covariance were conducted between groups with baseline as the covariate. RESULTS: Although PE-as-usual students showed decreases in primary outcomes, yoga students maintained or improved. Total mood disturbance improved in yoga students and worsened in controls (p = .015), as did Profile of Mood States-Short Form (POMS-SF) Tension-Anxiety subscale (p = .002). Although positive affect remained unchanged in both, negative affect significantly worsened in controls while improving in yoga students (p = .006). Secondary outcomes were not significant. Students rated yoga fairly high, despite moderate attendance. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation was feasible and students generally found it beneficial.

The aim of this study was to compare leadership instruction with a general technical instruction in a high-fidelity simulated cardiopulmonary resuscitation scenario. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, controlled superiority trial. SETTING: Simulator Center of the University Hospital Basel in Switzerland. SUBJECTS: Two-hundred thirty-seven volunteer medical students in teams of three. INTERVENTION: During a baseline visit, the medical students participated in a video-taped simulated witnessed cardiac arrest. Participants were thereafter randomized to receive instructions focusing either on correct positions of arms and shoulders (technical instruction group) or on leadership and communication to enhance team coordination (leadership instruction group). A follow-up simulation was conducted after 4 mos. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary outcome was the amount of hands-on time, defined as duration of uninterrupted cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the first 180 secs after the onset of the cardiac arrest (hands-on time) [corrected]. Secondary outcomes were time to start cardiopulmonary resuscitation, total leadership utterances, and technical skills.

After a balanced performance at baseline, the leadership instruction group demonstrated a longer hands-on time (120 secs; interquartile range, 98-135 vs. 87 secs; interquartile range, 61-108; p < .001), a shorter median time to start cardiopulmonary resuscitation (44 secs; interquartile range, 32-62; vs. 67 secs; interquartile range, 43-79; p = .018), and had more leadership utterances (7; interquartile range, 4-10; vs. 5; interquartile range, 2-8; p = .02) in the follow-up visit. The rate of correct arm and shoulder positions was higher in teams with technical instruction (59%; 19 out of 32; vs. 23%; 7 out of 31; p = .003).

3031563,Australia/New Zealand,College/University,Professional Training,"BACKGROUND: Shared decision making is a crucial component of evidence-based practice, but a lack of training in the 'how to' of it is a major barrier to its uptake. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a brief intervention for facilitating shared decision making skills in clinicians and student clinicians. DESIGN: Multi-centre randomized controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and seven medical students, physiotherapy or occupational therapy students undertaking a compulsory course in evidence-based practice as part of their undergraduate or postgraduate degree from two Australian universities. INTERVENTION: The 1-h small-group intervention consisted of facilitated critique of five-step framework, strategies, and pre-recorded modelled role-play. Both groups were provided with a chapter about shared decision making skills. MAIN MEASURES: The primary outcome was skills in shared decision making and communicating evidence [Observing Patient Involvement (OPTION) scale, items from the Assessing Communication about Evidence and Patient Preferences (ACEPP) Tool], rated by a blinded assessor from videorecorded role-plays. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: confidence in these skills and attitudes towards patient-centred communication (Patient Practitioner Orientation Scale (PPOS)). KEY RESULTS: Of participants, 95 % (102) completed the primary outcome measures. Two weeks post-intervention, intervention group participants scored significantly higher on the OPTION scale (adjusted group difference?=?18.9, 95 % CI 12.4 to 25.4), ACEPP items (difference?=?0.9, 95 % CI 0.5 to 1.3), confidence measure (difference?=?13.1, 95 % CI 8.5 to 17.7), and the PPOS sharing subscale (difference?=?0.2, 95 % CI 0.1 to 0.5). There was no significant difference for the PPOS caring subscale. CONCLUSIONS: This brief intervention was effective in improving student clinicians' ability, attitude towards, and confidence in shared decision making facilitation.

8154177,Australia/New Zealand,Primary/Elementary,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"Background: The implementation of nutrition policies in schools has been recommended as a strategy to improve child
dietary intake. Internationally, research suggests that the majority of schools do not implement these policies. In New
South Wales (NSW), Australia, the NSW Healthy School Canteen Policy requires that school canteens prohibit the sale of
‘red’ foods (i.e. foods that are typically nutrient poor and high in energy, such as confectionary and deep-fried foods) and
‘banned’drinks (i.e. soft drinks); and that the majority of items on the menu are ‘green’ (i.e. foods that are good sources of
nutrients, such fruits, vegetables and lean meats). This study examined the impact of a multicomponent audit and
feedback intervention on schools’ implementation of the NSW Healthy School Canteen Policy. A secondary aim was to
assess the impact of the intervention on menu composition.
Methods: This study was a parallel group randomised controlled trial with 72 rural and remote primary schools
(36 interventions, 36 controls) located in one region within NSW, Australia. Intervention schools received an initial face
to face contact and up to four cycles of audit and feedback (consisting of a menu audit, written feedback report and
telephone feedback) over a 12-month period. The primary trial outcomes were the proportion of schools with a
canteen menu that had: i) no ‘red’ foods or ‘banned’ drinks; and ii) >50% ‘green’ items, as assessed via standardised
menu audits undertaken by trained dietitians. For each primary outcome, between-group differences were assessed
using Fisher’s exact test under an intention to treat approach. Results: There was insufficient evidence to conclude the intervention had a positive impact on the proportion of
intervention schools with no ‘red’ or ‘banned’ items on their menu (RR = 2.8; 95% CI: 0.9 to 8.9; p = 0.0895), or on the
proportion of intervention schools with more than 50% ‘green’ items (RR = 1.5; 95% CI: 0.7 to 3.2; p = 0.2568). These
findings remained non-significant in the multiple imputation analyses. Intervention schools were significantly more likely
to have a lower percentage of ‘red’ items (p-value: 0.007) and a higher percentage of ‘green’ items on the menu (p-value:
0.014). This remained statistically significant in the multiple imputation analyses for ‘red items’ (p-value: 0.0081) but not for
‘green’ items (p-value: 0.0910).
Conclusions: While there was insufficient statistical evidence to suggest that this multicomponent audit and feedback
intervention was effective in improving primary schools’ compliance with a healthy canteen policy, the intervention
demonstrated some positive impact in reducing the availability of ‘red’ items on the menu.","CAFÉ: a multicomponent audit and

These are the first RCTs of a school gardening intervention in the United Kingdom. Method: Trial One consisted of 26 schools; these schools were randomised into two groups, one to receive the RHS led intervention and the other to receive the Teacher Led intervention. Trial Two consisted of 32 schools; these schools were randomised into either the Teacher Led or a comparison group with delayed intervention. Baseline data collection was conducted in September 2009 using a 24-hour food diary (CADET) to collect data on dietary intake and a questionnaire exploring children's knowledge and attitudes towards fruit and vegetables. Follow- up collection was conducted in December 2011. Results: 663 children completed trial one and 959 completed trial two, with a mean age of 9.7 years (SD: 0.6). Clustered regression analysis revealed the intervention had no impact on change in intake of fruit and vegetables for trial one (16 g, 95% confidence interval -10 to 43 g; p=0.23) or for trial two (22 g, 95% confidence intervals -82 to 38 g; p=0.4) after adjusting for gender, ethnicity and Index of Multiple Deprivation Score.

DESIGN: Randomized controlled factorial trial. SETTING: Eleven residency programs, in internal medicine (six), family medicine (three), and pediatrics (two). Programs were located in three university medical centers and four university-affiliated community hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: 261 residents who saw ambulatory care patients at least one half-day per week, and 937 returning patients aged 17 to 75 years who reported having smoked five or more cigarettes in the preceding seven days. Of the 937, 843 were eligible for follow-up, and 659 (78%) were interviewed by phone at six months. INTERVENTIONS: Two interventions (tutorial and prompt) and four groups. The tutorial was a two-hour educational program in minimal-contact smoking cessation counseling for residents. The prompt was a chart-based reminder to assist physician counseling. One group of residents received the tutorial; one, the prompt; and one, both. A fourth group received no intervention. MEASUREMENT AND RESULTS: Six months after the intervention, physician self-reports showed that residents in the tutorial + prompt and tutorial-only groups had used more counseling techniques (1.5-1.9) than had prompt-only or control residents (0.9). Residents in all three intervention groups advised more patients to quit smoking (76-79%) than did control group residents (69%). The tutorial had more effect on counseling practices than did the prompt. Physician confidence, perceived preparedness, and perceived success followed similar patterns. Exit interviews with 937 patients corroborated physician self-reports of counseling practices. Six months later, self-reported and biochemically verified patient quitting rates for residents in the three intervention groups (self-reported: 5.3-8.2%; biochemically verified: 3.4-5.7%) were higher than those for residents in the control group (self-reported: 5.2%; biochemically verified: 1.7%), though the differences were not statistically significant.

8155507,Asia,Middle/High School,Other School Subjects,"An alarming number of students drop out of junior high school in developing countries. In this study, we examine the impacts of providing a social-emotional learning (SEL) program on the dropout behavior and learning anxiety of students in the first two years of junior high. We do so by analyzing data from a randomized controlled trial involving 70 junior high schools and 7,495 students in rural China. After eight months, the SEL program reduces dropout by 1.6 percentage points and decreases learning anxiety by 2.3 percentage points. Effects are no longer statistically different from zero after 15 months, perhaps due to decreasing student interest in the program. However, we do find that the program reduces dropout among students at high risk of dropping out (older students and students with friends who have already dropped out), both after eight and 15 months of exposure to the SEL program.

The interventions were two types of class-based instruction on environmental issues, one long and the other short, which were designed to increase environmental awareness. Environmental attitudes and behaviours were measured by surveys completed by the students in their classes and in their homes before and after the interventions. The analysis reports school averages of the questionnaire responses, followed by regression analysis using robust clustered standard errors.

Case-based e-learning with an attractive clinical context could improve the attitude of medical students towards OH. The study question is whether case-based e-learning for medical students is more effective in improving knowledge, satisfaction and a positive attitude towards OH than non-case-based textbook learning. Methods: Participants, 141 second year medical students, were randomised to either case-based e-learning or text-based learning. Outcome measures were knowledge, satisfaction and attitude towards OH, measured at baseline, directly after the intervention, after 1 week and at 3-month follow-up. Results: Of the 141 participants, 130 (92%) completed the questionnaires at short-term follow-up and 41 (29%) at 3-month follow-up. At short-term follow-up, intervention and control groups did not show a significant difference in knowledge nor satisfaction but attitude towards OH was significantly more negative in the intervention group (F=4.041, p=0.047). At 3-month follow-up, there were no significant differences between intervention and control groups for knowledge, satisfaction and attitude. Conclusions: We found a significant decrease in favourable attitude during the internship in the experimental group compared with the control group.

learning. To encourage small-group learning, we challenged students to generate written questions during a
small-group work session. As gender differences have been shown to affect learning, these were also inventoried.
Methods: Prospective randomized study during a bachelor General Pathology course including 459 (bio) medical
students, 315 females and 144 males. The intervention was to individually generate an extra written question on
disease mechanisms, followed by a selection, by each student group, of the two questions considered to be most
relevant. These selected questions were open for discussion during the subsequent interactive lecture. Outcome
measure was the score on tumour pathology (range 1–10) on the course examination; the effect of gender was
assessed.
Results: The mean score per student was 7.2 (intervention) and 6.9 (control; p = 0.22). Male students in the
intervention group scored 0.5 point higher than controls (p = 0.05). In female students, this was only 0.1 point
higher (p = 0.75).
Conclusions: Formulating and prioritizing an extra written question during small-group work seems to exert a
positive learning effect on male students. This is an interesting approach to improve learning in male students, as

3031503,UK/Ireland,Middle/High School,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of classroom based cognitive behavioural therapy with attention control and usual school provision for adolescents at high risk of depression. DESIGN: Three arm parallel cluster randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Eight UK secondary schools. PARTICIPANTS: Adolescents (n=5030) aged 12-16 years in school year groups 8-11. Year groups were randomly assigned on a 1:1:1 ratio to cognitive behavioural therapy, attention control, or usual school provision. Allocation was balanced by school, year, number of students and classes, frequency of lessons, and timetabling. Participants were not blinded to treatment allocation. INTERVENTIONS: Cognitive behavioural therapy, attention control, and usual school provision provided in classes to all eligible participants. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes were collected by self completed questionnaire administered by researchers. The primary outcome was symptoms of depression assessed at 12 months by the short mood and feelings questionnaire among those identified at baseline as being at high risk of depression. Secondary outcomes included negative thinking, self worth, and anxiety. Analyses were undertaken on an intention to treat basis and accounted for the clustered nature of the design. RESULTS: 1064 (21.2%) adolescents were identified at high risk of depression: 392 in the classroom based cognitive behavioural therapy arm, 374 in the attention control arm, and 298 in the usual school provision arm. At 12 months adjusted mean scores on the short mood and feelings questionnaire did not differ for cognitive behavioural therapy versus attention control (-0.63, 95% confidence interval -1.85 to 0.58, P=0.41) or for cognitive behavioural therapy versus usual school provision (0.97, -0.20 to 2.15, P=0.12). CONCLUSION: In adolescents with depressive symptoms, outcomes were similar for attention control, usual school provision, and cognitive behavioural therapy.

We investigated the effect of a classroom-based cognitive behaviour therapy prevention programme (FRIENDS) on anxiety symptoms in children. Methods: Preventing Anxiety in Children though Education in Schools (PACES) is a three-group parallel cluster randomised controlled trial. Interventions were given between September, 2011, and July, 2012, with schools as the unit of allocation and individual participants as the unit of analysis. We enrolled state-funded junior schools in southwest England. We sent information to all eligible schools (state-funded junior schools in southwest England) inviting them to enrol in the study. School year groups were assigned by computer-generated randomisation (1:1:1) to receive either school-led FRIENDS (led by teacher or school staff member), health-led FRIENDS (led by two trained health facilitators), or usual school provision. Children were not masked to treatment allocation. The allocated programme was given to all students (aged 9-10 years) in the school year (ie, universal delivery) as part of the school curriculum as nine, 60 min weekly sessions. Outcomes were collected by self-completed questionnaire administered by researchers masked to allocation. Primary outcome was symptoms of anxiety and low mood at 12 months assessed by the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS 30). Analyses were intention to treat and accounted for the clustered nature of the design. The study is registered, number ISRCTN23563048. Findings: 45 schools were enrolled: 14 (n=497 children) were randomly assigned to school-led FRIENDS, 14 (n=509) to health-led FRIENDS, and 12 (n=442) to usual school provision. 1257 (92%) children completed 12 month assessments (449 in health-led FRIENDS, 436 in school-led FRIENDS, and 372 in usual school provision).

This article presents a randomised controlled field experiment on the effects of CLIL on students' science learning. Thirty sixth-grade intermediate-track German secondary-school classes (722 students) were randomly assigned to learn (5 lessons, 90 min each) a physics topic taught either in German or in English and German. We expected that the monolingually taught students would outperform the bilingually taught ones immediately after the intervention. For the follow-up test 6 weeks later, the same or smaller differences between the groups were expected due to the potential for a deeper processing of the subject matter in the bilingual condition. The results showed that the bilingually educated students' learning gains were smaller than the monolingually educated ones' immediately after the intervention (d = −0.21) and at follow-up (d = −0.23). The expectation of more sustainable processing was not supported.

Results of a two-year cluster-randomized (36 schools) clinical trial of Second Step Middle School Program (Committee for Children, 2008) on reducing aggression and victimization are presented. Teachers implemented 28 lessons (6th & 7th-grade) that focused on social emotional learning skills (e.g., empathy, problem-solving). All 6th graders (n = 3658) completed self-report measures assessing bullying, aggression, homophobic name-calling and sexual harassment at three waves. Multilevel analyses revealed significant intervention effects for two of the seven outcomes. Students in intervention schools were 56% less likely to self-report homophobic name-calling victimization and 39% less likely to report sexual violence perpetration than students in control schools in one state.

8154910,USA/Canada,College/University,Range of Academic Outcomes,"Many college students abandon their goal of completing a degree in science, technology, engineering, or
math (STEM) when confronted with challenging introductory-level science courses. In the U.S., this
trend is more pronounced for underrepresented minority (URM) and first-generation (FG) students, and
contributes to persisting racial and social-class achievement gaps in higher education. Previous intervention
studies have focused exclusively on race or social class, but have not examined how the 2 may
be confounded and interact. This research therefore investigates the independent and interactive effects
of race and social class as moderators of an intervention designed to promote performance, measured by
grade in the course. In a double-blind randomized experiment conducted over 4 semesters of an
introductory biology course (N   1,040), we tested the effectiveness of a utility-value intervention in
which students wrote about the personal relevance of course material. The utility-value intervention was
successful in reducing the achievement gap for FG-URM students by 61%: the performance gap for
FG-URM students, relative to continuing generation (CG)-Majority students, was large in the control
condition, .84 grade points (d   .98), and the treatment effect for FG-URM students was .51 grade points
(d   0.55). The UV intervention helped students from all groups find utility value in the course content,
and mediation analyses showed that the process of writing about utility value was particularly powerful
for FG-URM students. Results highlight the importance of intersectionality in examining the independent
and interactive effects of race and social class when evaluating interventions to close achievement gaps
and the mechanisms through which they may operate.","Closing Achievement Gaps With a Utility-Value Intervention:

3030586,USA/Canada,Primary/Elementary,Behaviour and Social Wellbeing,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of an early childhood, family-centered, school-based intervention on children's kindergarten academic achievement. METHODS: This was a cluster (school) randomized controlled trial with assessments from pre-kindergarten (pre-k) entry through the end of kindergarten. The setting was 10 public elementary schools with 26 pre-k classes in 2 school districts in urban disadvantaged neighborhoods serving a largely black, low-income population. Participants were 1050 black and Latino, low-income children (age 4; 88% of pre-k population) enrolled in 10 schools over 4 years. Universal intervention aimed to promote self-regulation and early learning by strengthening positive behavior support and effective behavior management at home and school, and increasing parent involvement in education. Intervention included after-school group sessions for families of pre-k students (13 2-hour sessions; co-led by pre-k teachers) and professional development for pre-k and kindergarten teachers. The outcome measures were standardized test scores of kindergarten reading, writing, and math achievement by independent evaluators masked to intervention condition (primary outcome); developmental trajectories of teacher-rated academic performance from pre-k through kindergarten (secondary outcome). RESULTS: Relative to children in control schools, children in intervention schools had higher kindergarten achievement test scores (Cohen's d = 0.18, mean difference = 2.64, SE = 0.90, P = .03) and higher teacher-rated academic performance (Cohen's d = 0.25, mean difference = 5.65, SE = 2.34, P = .01).

The interventions were peer-mentoring and participative learning. Year 7 children (aged 11-12) in the peer-mentoring intervention were paired with year 9 children for 6 weekly mentoring meetings. Year 7 children in the participative learning arm took part in 6 weekly geography lessons using personalised physical activity and Global Positioning System (GPS) data. Year 7 children in the combined intervention received both interventions, with the year 9 children only participating in the mentoring sessions.PARTICIPANTS: 1494 year 7 students from 60 schools in the North of England took part in the trial. Of these, 43 students opted out of taking part in the evaluation measurements, 2 moved teaching group and 58 changed school. Valid accelerometry outcome data were collected for 892 students from 53 schools; and well-being outcome data were available for 927 students from 52 schools.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes were mean minutes of accelerometer-measured moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity per day, and well-being as evaluated by the KIDSCREEN-27 questionnaire. These data were collected 6?weeks after the intervention; a 12-month follow-up is planned.RESULTS: No significant effects (main or interaction) were observed for the outcomes. However, small positive differences were found for both outcomes for the participative learning intervention.CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the 2 school-based interventions did not modify levels of physical activity or well-being within the period monitored.

Despite broad calls for primary prevention, few programs with demonstrated effectiveness exist. This cluster-randomized trial examined the effectiveness of a DV perpetration prevention program targeting coaches and high school male athletes. METHODS: The unit of randomization was the high school (16 schools), and the unit of analysis was the athlete (N = 2,006 students). Primary outcomes were intentions to intervene, recognition of abusive behaviors, and gender-equitable attitudes. Secondary outcomes explored bystander behaviors and abuse perpetration. Regression models for clustered, longitudinal data assessed between-arm differences in over-time changes in mean levels of continuous outcomes in 1,798 athletes followed up at 3 months. RESULTS: Intervention athletes' changes in intentions to intervene were positive compared with control subjects, resulting in an estimated intervention effect of .12 (95% CI: .003, .24). Intervention athletes also reported higher levels of positive bystander intervention behavior than control subjects (.25, 95% CI: .13, .38). Changes in gender-equitable attitudes, recognition of abusive behaviors, and DV perpetration were not significant. Secondary analyses estimated intervention impacts according to intensity of program implementation.

This study tested a modular cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) program for children with this profile. A standard CBT program was augmented with multiple treatment components designed to accommodate or remediate the social and adaptive skill deficits of children with ASD that could pose barriers to anxiety reduction. Method: Forty children (7-11 years old) were randomly assigned to 16 sessions of CBT or a 3-month waitlist (36 completed treatment or waitlist). Therapists worked with individual families. The CBT model emphasized behavioral experimentation, parent-training, and school consultation. Independent evaluators blind to treatment condition conducted structured diagnostic interviews and parents and children completed anxiety symptom checklists at baseline and posttreatment/postwaitlist. Results: In intent-to-treat analyses, 78.5% of the CBT group met Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale criteria for positive treatment response at posttreatment, as compared to only 8.7% of the waitlist group.

The researchers found that most students in both 'CT' and control groups improved overall on the NWEA General Math Test. They did not find a difference in student performance in math between groups. Their analysis of the Algebraic Operations sub-strand revealed that many students in both groups did not demonstrate the growth in this scale, again with no discernible group differences. However, for Algebraic Operations outcomes, the researchers found a significant interaction between the pre-test and 'CT': student scoring low before participating in 'CT' got more benefit from the program's algebraic operations instruction than students with high initial scores.

3031184,USA/Canada,Primary/Elementary,Literacy/English,"This research project consists of a randomized experiment in St. Petersburg Catholic Schools. The question being addressed by the research is whether 'Scott Foresman Science' is as effective as the current curricula being used in the participating campuses of the Roman Catholic Diocese of St. Petersburg. The research focuses on 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade students. The outcomes were measured by student achievement on standardized tests administered at the beginning and end of the project. Two test areas were selected as the outcome measures: Science Concepts and Processes, and Reading Achievement. The overall comparison between Scott Foresman Science ('SFScience') and the program used in the control classroom was just the first step in the investigation. The authors also aimed to understand how the product was implemented and other ways that science instruction differed between the two groups. In addition, they sought to understand how characteristics of the students and of the teachers may have moderated the impact, that is, whether 'SFScience' was more effective with students or teachers with differing abilities or experience. Finally, they explored the extent to which the groups differed in amount of time devoted to science or specifically to inquiry and whether those differences may help to explain the results. The design of the experiment reflects the requirements of the No Child Left Behind Act, which directs schools to consult reports of rigorous research in making adoption decisions about instructional programs. The study was designed to provide useful information to support local decisions that take into account the specifics of district characteristics and their implementation of the program. This report provides a rich description of the conditions of implementation in order to assist the district in strengthening its program and to provide the reader with an understanding of the context for the findings.

3031172,USA/Canada,Middle/High School,Numeracy/Maths,"The authors sought evidence of the effectiveness of the TI-Navigator classroom networking system for the second year of a two-year research study of Texas Instruments classroom technology. This randomized control trial compared Algebra I and Geometry instruction using the TI-Navigator system, which includes the TI-84 Silver Edition graphing calculator, to instruction with graphing calculators alone. The technologies did not provide a separate math curriculum, but did not include curricular materials. The authors asked whether students in classrooms with access to the TI-Navigator system and training, achieve higher scores than students in classrooms receiving only graphing calculators and training, whether TI-Navigator has a differential impact for students with various incoming math achievement levels, and whether the impact depends on gender or English proficiency. For the most part, the experiment could not discern an impact as a result of providing the equipment and training for TI-Navigator. In Algebra, while they found no overall difference, there was some evidence of a small negative impact for students scoring 'below basic' on the CST and, holding pretest score constant, for English proficient students. Overall, the authors found that the TI-Navigator affected the average number of minutes the technology was used.

5132544,Rest of Europe,College/University,Other School Subjects,"Peer instruction has been recognized as an instructional method having a positive impact on learning compared to traditional lectures in science. This method has been widely supported by the socio-constructivist approach to learning giving a positive role to interaction between peers in the construction of knowledge. As far as we know, no study has been conducted from the socio-cognitive approach which suggests that individuals working alone perform better than those interacting with others in groups. Thus, the aim of the present study was to examine whether peer instruction improves learning when compared with an individual learning method that does not require any interaction with peers. After being randomly divided into either a peer instruction or an individual learning condition in a chromatography course, students had to answer to a series of multiple-choice questions using clickers at the beginning (pre-test) and end of (post-test) the session. Results revealed that the percentage of correct answers increased similarly from the pre- to the post-test in both conditions. Nevertheless, students perceived the peer instruction method as being more satisfying, engaging and useful than the individual learning method. The findings revealed that peer instruction provides subjective benefits, but failed to demonstrate a greater learning gain.

The purpose of this study was to compare the reading achievement of eighth grade students in an urban middle school in Southeast Texas who participated in two different reading/writing classroom configurations. One group of students participated in an integrated reading and writing class with the same teacher for a 90 minute block and the other group had non-integrated reading and writing teachers for a 45 minute blocks each. The achievement scores of students in integrated reading and writing classes were compared to students in non-integrated classes based on the variables gender and ethnicity. The research results determined that integrated reading and writing yielded higher reading achievement averages in six out of the seven hypotheses that were evaluated. Students who participated in integrated reading and writing performed better as a whole when compared to students non-integrated reading and writing classes. In regards to gender, the mean female integrated students' reading score was 38.63 (SD = 8.82) and the mean female non-integrated students reading score was 35.42 (SD = 8.69). The mean reading score for male students in integrated classes was 37.80 (SD = 8.74) and the mean reading score for male students in non-integrated classes was 32.87 (SD = 8.64). Using data for ethnicity, it was determined that Hispanic and African American students who participated in integrated reading and writing had better reading achievement averages than Hispanic and African American students who were instructed using the non-integrated reading and writing method. The mean reading score for African American students in the integrated classes was 37.55 (SD = 8.17) and the mean reading score for African American students in the non-integrated classes was 33.61 (SD = 8.53). The mean score for Hispanics students in the integrated classes was 37.18 (SD = 8.710 and for those in the non-integrated classes, it was 33.88 (SD = 8.84). On the other hand, the data showed that when ethnicity was evaluated as a whole group, Hispanics versus African —Americans, there was no significant difference in the groups' reading academic achievement. The mean reading score for Hispanic students was 34.09 (SD = 9.08) and for African American students, 34.63 (SD = 8.59).

3031485,Rest of Europe,College/University,Professional Training,"OBJECTIVES: To compare 2 educational programmes for teaching evidence-based medicine (EBM). DESIGN: Prospective randomised controlled trial accompanied by a qualitative evaluation. SETTING: University of Oslo, Norway, 2002-03. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 175 students entered the study. All tenth semester medical students from 3 semesters were eligible for inclusion if they completed baseline assessment and consent forms and either attended teaching on the first day of the semester or gave reasons for their absence on the first day in advance. Interventions One intervention was based on computer-assisted, self-directed learning (self-directed intervention), whilst the other was organised as workshops based on social learning theory (directed intervention). Both educational interventions consisted of 5 half-day sessions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes were knowledge about EBM and skills in critical appraisal. A secondary outcome measured attitudes to EBM. Outcomes were compared on an intention-to-treat basis using a stratified Wilcoxon rank-sum test. RESULTS: There were no differences in outcomes for the 2 study groups in terms of EBM knowledge (mean deviation 0.0 [95% confidence interval - 1.0, 1.0], P = 0.8), critical appraisal skills (MD 0.1 [95% CI - 0.9, 1.1], P = 0.5), or attitudes to EBM (MD - 0.3 [95% CI - 1.4, 0.8], P = 0.5). Follow-up rates were 96%, 97% and 63%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This trial and its accompanying qualitative evaluation suggest that self-directed, computer-assisted learning may be an alternative format for teaching EBM.

We aimed to determine if an anti-smoking media literacy curriculum improves students&apos; media literacy and affects factors related to adolescent smoking. Methods: We recruited 1170 9th-grade students from 64 classrooms in 3 public urban high schools. Students were randomized by classroom to a media literacy curriculum versus a standard educational program. In an intent-to-treat analysis, we used multilevel modeling to determine if changes in study outcomes were associated with the curricular intervention, controlling for baseline student covariates and the clustering of students within classrooms. Results: Among participants, mean age was 14.5 years and 51% were male, with no significant differences in baseline characteristics between groups. Smoking media literacy changed more among intervention participants compared with control participants (0.24 vs. 0.08, p < 0.001). Compared with controls, intervention students exhibited a greater reduction in the perceived prevalence of smoking (-14.0% vs. -4.6%, p < 0.001). Among those initially susceptible to smoking, intervention participants more commonly reverted to being nonsusceptible post-intervention (24% vs. 16%, p = 0.08).

3031351,Rest of Europe,College/University,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"OBJECTIVE: Adherence of young adults to preventive programmes is low. The following study compares three different educational concepts to increase toothbrushing adherence in young adults. METHODS: Nine vocational school classes (157 young adults) were randomly assigned to three different 60-min approaches: (I) Education by a dentist, (II) Peer-teaching and (III) 'Adherence triangle concept' uniting dentists, teachers and participants as equal partners in intervention planning combined with peer teaching. Follow-up was 1 week for approaches I and II, and 1 week, 3 and 9 months for approach III. Adherence was defined as reported change from the childhood toothbrushing technique to adult technique. Adherence was evaluated using anonymous questionnaires and by diary analysis. RESULTS: After instruction, 90% of participants (approaches I-III) showed the desired behaviour in practice and theory. Reported adherence after 1 week with approach I was 28.5%, with approach II 39% and with approach III 95%. Prolonged follow-up of approach III yielded 76% after 3 months and 68% after 9 months. Adherence using approach III was significantly higher (P ? 0.001) than using approach I and II after 1 week. Adherence rates with approach III after 9 months were still higher than those of approaches I and II after 1 week.

Aim: To prospectively compare the impact of real patients, digital, paper PBL (PPBL) and traditional lecture-based learning (LBL) on academic results and student perceptions. Methods: A total of 120 students were randomly allocated into either real-patients PBL (RPBL) group studied via real-patient cases, digital PBL (DPBL) group studied via digital-form cases, PPBL group studied via paper-form cases, or conventional group who received didactic lectures. Academic results were assessed through review of written examination, objective structured clinical examination and student performance scores. A five-point Likert scale questionnaire was used to evaluate student perceptions. Results: Compared to those receiving lectures only, all PBL participants had better results for written examination, clinical examination and overall performance. Students in RPBL group exhibited better overall performance than those in the other two PBL groups. Real-patient cases were more effective in helping develop studentsï¿½ self-directed learning skills, improving their confidence in future patient encounters and encouraging them to learn more about the discussed condition, compared to digital and paper cases.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of two contrasting approaches to school-based smoking prevention in South African youth compared to the standard health education program. One experimental program was based on a skills training/peer resistance model and the other on a harm minimization model. METHOD: Thirty-six public schools from two South African provinces, KwaZulu-Natal and the Western Cape, were stratified by socioeconomic status and randomized to one of three groups. Group 1 (comparison) schools (n = 12) received usual tobacco use education. Group 2 schools (n = 12) received a harm minimization curriculum in grades 8 and 9. Group 3 schools (n = 12) received a life skills training curriculum in grades 8 and 9. The primary outcome was past month use of cigarettes based on a self-reported questionnaire. RESULT: Five thousand two hundred sixty-six students completed the baseline survey. Of these, 4,684 (89%) completed at least one follow-up assessment. The net change in 30-day smoking from baseline to 2-year follow-up in the control group was 6% compared to 3% in both harm minimization (HM) and life skills training (LST) schools. These differences were not statistically significant. Intervention response was significantly moderated by both gender and race. The HM intervention was more effective for males, whereas the life skills intervention was more effective for females. For black African students, the strongest effect was evident for the HM intervention, whereas the strongest intervention effect for 'colored' students was evident for the LST group. CONCLUSION: The two experimental curricula both produced similar overall reductions in smoking prevalence that were not significantly different from each other or the control group. However, the impact differed by gender and race, suggesting a need to tailor tobacco and drug use prevention programs.

3030742,UK/Ireland,College/University,Study-Related Skills,"Background: Exposure therapy is effective for phobic anxiety disorders (specific phobias, agoraphobia, social phobia) and panic disorder. Despite their high prevalence in the community, sufferers often get no treatment or if they do, it is usually after a long delay. This is largely due to the scarcity of healthcare professionals trained in exposure therapy, which is due, in part, to the high cost of training. Traditional teaching methods employed are labour intensive, being based mainly on role-play in small groups with feedback and coaching from experienced trainers. In an attempt to increase knowledge and skills in exposure therapy, there is now some interest in providing relevant teaching as part of pre-registration nurse education. Computers have been developed to teach terminology and simulate clinical scenarios for health professionals, and offer a potentially cost effective alternative to traditional teaching methods. Objective: To test whether student nurses would learn about exposure therapy for phobia/panic as well by computer-aided self-instruction as by face-to-face teaching, and to compare the individual and combined effects of two educational methods, traditional face-to-face teaching comprising a presentation with discussion and questions/answers by a specialist cognitive behaviour nurse therapist, and a computer-aided self-instructional programme based on a self-help programme for patients with phobia/panic called FearFighter, on students' knowledge, skills and satisfaction. Design: Randomised controlled trial, with a crossover, completed in 2 consecutive days over a period of 4 h per day. Participants: Ninety-two mental health pre-registration nursing students, of mixed gender, age and ethnic origin, with no previous training in cognitive behaviour therapy studying at one UK university. Results: The two teaching methods led to similar improvements in knowledge and skills, and to similar satisfaction, when used alone. Using them in tandem conferred no added benefit. Computer-aided self-instruction was more efficient as it saved teacher preparation and delivery time, and needed no specialist tutor. Conclusion: Computer-aided self-instruction saved almost all preparation time and delivery effort for the expert teacher. When added to past results in medical students, the present results in nurses justify the use of computer-aided self-instruction for learning about exposure therapy and phobia/panic and of research into its value for other areas of health education.

During 2002 to 2003, the authors conducted a multicenter, randomized, controlled, double-blind trial to investigate the effect of improving WM by computerized, systematic practice of WM tasks. Method: Included in the trial were 53 children with ADHD (9 girls; 15 of 53 inattentive subtype), aged 7 to 12 years, without stimulant medication. The compliance criterion (>20 days of training) was met by 44 subjects, 42 of whom were also evaluated at follow-up 3 months later. Participants were randomly assigned to use either the treatment computer program for training WM or a comparison program. The main outcome measure was the span-board task, a visuospatial WM task that was not part of the training program. Results: For the span-board task, there was a significant treatment effect both post-intervention and at follow-up. In addition, there were significant effects for secondary outcome tasks measuring verbal WM, response inhibition, and complex reasoning. Parent ratings showed significant reduction in symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity, both post-intervention and at follow-up. Conclusions: This study shows that WM can be improved by training in children with ADHD. This training also improved response inhibition and reasoning and resulted in a reduction of the parent-rated inattentive symptoms of ADHD.","Computerized Training of Working Memory in Children with ADHD-A Randomized, Controlled Trial","https://www.google.com/search?q=Computerized+Training+of+Working+Memory+in+Children+with+ADHD-A+Randomized,+Controlled+Trial",2004,Targeted,Regular Teachers/Lecturers,Between Half and Full Term,none,none,Single,52,NA,Yes,Whole Sample Only,At Least Some Follow-Up,Yes,"Yes, Fairly Well","Yes, Theoretical Perspectives",Yes,Rest of Europe Multiple Study-Related Skills

The main aim of our randomized control study was to examine the efficacy of Coping Power, adapted as a universal prevention program, in reducing childrenï¿½s behavioral problems and improving school grades. Nine classes participated (184 students, mean age 91 months) from two elementary state schools in Tuscany, Italy.

Fewer studies have examined whether changes in cognition are associated with changes in social functioning. This study examined whether cognitive gains among 192 students from 47 kindergarten-through-second-grade autism support classrooms participating in a year-long behavioral intervention study were associated with gains in social functioning. Childrenï¿½s gains in cognitive ability were modestly associated with independent assessorsï¿½ and teachersï¿½ evaluations of social functioning but were not associated with changes in parent ratings. Observed social gains were not commensurate with gains in cognition, suggesting the need both for interventions that directly target social functioning and relevant field measures of social functioning.

3031568,USA/Canada,Middle/High School,Other School Subjects,"Introduction: School-based cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and automated external defibrillator (AED) use training currently occur in approximately 50% of schools. Many attribute this to the increased time and cost of instructor-led programs. Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of video-based CPR training programs in adults, but little is known about the impact of this technique in schoolchildren. We compared skill, willingness, and confidence in performing CPR and applying an AED between students receiving training though a traditional instructor-led course and a video-based training program. Methods: Grade 9 students were randomized to a 4-hour instructor-led course or a 45-minute video-based training course. Each student completed an attitudinal questionnaire (confidence, competence, willingness) at three time points: pretraining, immediately post-training, and 6 months posttraining. Performance skill testing was completed posttraining and 6 months later. Skill testing included evaluation of CPR quality and a measure of overall competence using a previously validated scoring tool. Results: A total of 307 students were randomized and completed the initial training; 86% completed follow-up testing at 6 months. Significant improvements in both training groups occurred across all attitudinal domains following training (p < 0.001). The Cronbach alpha for each attitudinal domain was 0.751 (confidence), 0.902 (competence), and 0.779 (willingness). Performance skill testing of CPR quality and overall competence score were not significantly different across training interventions when evaluated posttraining and 6 months later. Conclusions: Both groups reported improved confidence, competence, and willingness to perform CPR and use an AED after training. Both groups demonstrated similar skill test performance scores posttraining.

3031479,USA/Canada,Primary/Elementary,Numeracy/Maths,"This study, sponsored by the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) in the U.S. Department of Education, examines whether some early elementary school math curricula are more effective than others at improving student math achievement in disadvantaged schools. A small number of curricula, which are based on different approaches for developing student math skills, dominate elementary math instruction--7 curricula make up 91 percent of those used by K-2 educators, according to a 2008 survey (Resnick et al. 2010). The main questions addressed by the study are: (1) What are the relative effects of the study's four math curricula on math achievement of first- and second-graders in disadvantaged schools? and (2) Are the relative curriculum effects influenced by school and classroom characteristics? The study is addressing these questions by examining the relative effects of four diverse curricula selected through a competitive process, recruiting schools to participate in the study, having publishers provide schools and teachers with curriculum materials and training, assessing student math achievement, and evaluating the effects of the curricula (including materials, training, content, and pedagogy) on student achievement. Other data (including school records, teacher surveys, and classroom observations) also were collected to examine whether relative curriculum effects are influenced by context and to conduct mediational analyses. The study team collected all data necessary to evaluate the four curricula. To measure the achievement effects of the curricula, the study team tested students at the beginning and end of the school year using the math assessment developed for the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS-K) (West et al. 2000). The ECLS-K assessment is a nationally normed test designed to measure achievement gains both within and across elementary grades. The first- and second-grade results are based on students who were tested in both the fall and spring in those respective grades. As math skills have grown in importance in the workplace, so has the debate over how best to improve students' math skills. This study is an important step toward resolving that debate because it shows that four widely-used curricula have differential effects on student math achievement. These differential effects, which were measured after just one year of curriculum implementation, suggest that districts should carefully choose their math curriculum.

METHODS: Four inner city elementary schools in the Northeastern United States were randomized to an intervention (n=149) or control group (n=148) in 2005. Fruit and vegetable consumption during school lunch (measured by plate waste), preferences, and knowledge, as well as body mass index, were assessed five times across 3.5 years (pre-intervention, spring 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009). Hierarchical linear modeling was used to analyze program outcomes. RESULTS: At the first post-test assessment, children in the experimental group ate 0.28 more servings/lunch of fruit and vegetable relative to children in the control group and changes in fruit and vegetable consumption were found in each year throughout the program. However, this effect declined steadily across time so that by the delayed one-year follow-up period there was no difference between the groups in fruit and vegetable consumption. There were persistent intervention effects on children's knowledge. There were no effects on fruit and vegetable preferences and body mass index throughout the study. CONCLUSION: Although there was initial fruit and vegetable behavior change, annual measurements indicated a gradual decay of behavioral effects.

Aims: To investigate the relative effectiveness of indirect and direct intervention therapy modes delivered individually or in groups for children with primary language impairment. Methods & Procedures: A multi-centre randomized controlled trial investigated 161 children with primary language impairment aged 6-11 years randomized to a usual-therapy control group or to direct individual, indirect individual, direct group or indirect group therapy modes. Intervention was delivered three times a week for 30-40-min sessions in mainstream schools over 15 weeks. Language performance was assessed at baseline, post-therapy and at 12 months. Cost analysis was based on salary and travel costs for intervention modes and usual therapy. Outcomes & Results: Compared with controls, children receiving project therapy made short-term improvements in expressive (p = 0.031), but not receptive, language immediately following intervention. Children with specific expressive language delay were more likely to show improvement than those with mixed receptive-expressive difficulties. The four project therapy modes did not differ on primary language outcomes (all p-values greater than 0.392) and there were no further improvements evident at follow-up.

3030612,USA/Canada,Middle/High School,Behaviour and Social Wellbeing,"Integrating social and emotional learning (SEL) programming throughout curricula to support the development of healthy behaviors and prevent violence is critical for a comprehensive approach to school health. This study used a post-test comparison design to evaluate a healthy relationships program for eighth grade students that applies a SEL approach. The program was adapted from the Fourth R, an evidence-based program for ninth graders, but matches the curriculum and developmental context for eighth graders. Surveys were collected post-intervention from 1012 students within 57 schools randomized to intervention or control conditions. Multivariate multilevel analysis accounted for the nested nature of students within schools. There were significant group differences on three of four outcomes following intervention, including improved knowledge about violence, critical thinking around the impact of violence, and identification of more successful coping strategies. There was no group difference on general acceptance of violence. Overall, students learned relevant information and strategies and were able to apply that knowledge to demonstrate critical thinking, suggesting that adapting an evidence-based approach for use with younger students provided similar benefits. These findings build a case for 2 years of consecutive evidence-based healthy relationships programming in grades 8 and 9, consistent with best practice guidelines.

3030870,Australia/New Zealand,Middle/High School,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Declines in adolescent smoking prevalence have slowed recently, resulting in increased interest and literature in tobacco harm minimisation. To date, harm reduction strategies have focused largely on modifying the product and alternative (safer) mechanisms of nicotine delivery. There has been little exploration of primary harm minimisation to prevent the onset of regular smoking among young people. A major concern expressed about harm reduction interventions and young people is that they may increase experimentation among non-users. DESIGN AND METHODS: The Smoking Cessation for Youth Project was a 2-year school-based cluster randomised controlled trial conducted in 30 Western Australian schools. Results on the primary outcome showed a significant reduction in regular smoking among 4636 13-15-year-olds receiving a harm minimisaton versus standard intervention. This paper addresses the intervention effects on 2078 students who had not smoked at baseline. RESULTS: At 20-month follow-up, smoking initiation was slightly lower among intervention students than comparison students (who received a largely abstinence-based intervention), although this difference did not attain statistical significance (OR=0.86; 95% confidence interval: 0.68, 1.09). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: This study provided limited evidence to suggest that harm minimisation is a superior approach to abstinence-based interventions for non-smokers. However, this intervention did not contribute to increased experimentation among non-smokers. Although more trials are required, these results indicate that fears of potential negative iatrogenic effects from school-based harm minimisation interventions may be unwarranted.",Does harm minimisation lead to greater experimentation?

in standard examinations. We explored students’ exam performance after viewing video of patients’ experiences.
Methods: Eighty-eight medical students were randomized to one of two e-learning modules. The experimental group saw
video clips of patients describing their colposcopy, while the control group viewed a clinician describing the procedure.
Students then completed a Multiple Choice Questionnaire (MCQ) and were assessed by a blinded clinical examiner in an
Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) with a blinded simulated patient (SP). The SP scored students using the
Doctors’ Interpersonal Skills Questionnaire (DISQ). Students rated the module’s effect on their skills and confidence.
Regression analyses were used to compare the effect of the two modules on these outcomes, adjusting for gender and
graduate entry.
Results: The experimental group performed better in the OSCE than the control group (odds ratio 2.7 [95%CI 1.2–6.1];
p¼0.016). They also reported significantly more confidence in key areas, including comfort with patients’ emotions (odds
ratio 6.4 [95%CI 2.7–14.9]; p<0.0005). There were no other significant differences.

This study presents new evidence on this issue by evaluating data from Tennessee's Career Ladder Evaluation System and the Project STAR class-size experiment. Because the students and teachers participating in the experiment were randomly assigned, inferences about the relative quality of teachers certified by the career ladder should be unbiased. The results indicate that Tennessee's career ladder had mixed success in rewarding teachers who increased student achievement.

METHODS: We carried out a controlled trial in which two sub-cohorts of GPTs were allocated to an intervention group (n = 23) or a control group (n = 30), respectively. In 2006, allocated first-year GPTs in the VU University Medical Centre attended a patient feedback training programme in addition to the regular communication skills training. The control group attended only regular communication skills training. Trainees were assessed by simulated patients who visited the practices and videotaped the consultations at baseline and after 3 months. The videotapes were randomly assigned to eight trained staff members. The MAAS-Global Instrument (range 0-6) was used to assess (a change in) trainee consultation skills. RESULTS: were analysed using a multi-level, linear mixed-model analysis. Results Data on 50 GPTs were available for the follow-up analysis. Both intervention group and control group GPTs improved their consultation skills: mean MAAS-Global scores for all participants were 3.29 (standard deviation [SD] 0.75) at baseline and 3.54 (SD 0.66) at follow-up (P = 0.047). The improvement in MAAS-Global scores in the intervention group did not differ significantly from the improvement in the control group. The analysis showed a trend for intensity of participation in the patient feedback programme to predict greater improvement in MAAS-Global scores. DISCUSSION: Although the baseline scores were already in the high range, consultation skills in both groups improved significantly. This is reassuring for current teaching methods. The patient feedback programme did not improve consultation skills more than regular communication skills training. However, a subgroup of GPTs who participated intensively in the programme did improve their consultation skills further in comparison with the less motivated subgroup.",Does patient feedback improve the consultation skills of general practice trainees?

This study highlights the connections between two facets of teachersï¿½ skillsï¿½those supporting teachersï¿½ mathematical instructional interactions and those underlying social interactions within the classroom. The impact of the Responsive Classroom (RC) approach and use of RC practices on the use of standards-based mathematics teaching practices was investigated in third-grade classrooms. Eighty-eight third-grade teachers from 24 elementary schools in a large suburban district were selected from a sample of teachers participating in a larger randomized-control study. Results showed that teachers at schools assigned randomly to receive training in the RC approach showed higher use of standards-based mathematics teaching practices than teachers in control schools. These findings were supported by analyses using fidelity of implementation: greater adherence to the intervention predicted the use of more standards-based mathematics teaching practices.

Intensive working memory training has been shown to boost performance on untrained memory tasks in a variety of populations. This first randomized controlled trial with low working memory children investigated whether the benefits of training extend beyond standard working memory tasks to other more complex activities typical of the classroom in which working memory plays a role, as well as to other cognitive skills and developing academic abilities. Children aged 7-9 years received either adaptive working memory training, non-adaptive working memory training with low memory loads, or no training. Adaptive training was associated with selective improvements in multiple untrained tests of working memory, with no evidence of changes in classroom analogues of activities that tax working memory, or any other cognitive assessments. Gains in verbal working memory were sustained one year after training.

3031085,USA/Canada,Multiple,Professional Training,"The Distributed Leadership Teacher Training Program (DLT) was implemented to improve student's learning in the United States. However, empirical evidence of the effectiveness of DLT still lacks. This dissertation investigates the effectiveness of DLT using data from the first experimental study of distributed leadership in the United States. The study focuses on the analytic approaches and statistical models to analyze this complex interventionï¿½a longitudinal cluster randomized control trial with cross-overs and unequal probability of treatment assignment. In 2005 the Distributed Leadership Teacher Training Program (DLT) was launched in the School District of Philadelphia funded by the Annenberg Foundation. This multifaceted professional development program for school leadership teams composed of principals and teacher leaders aims to improve student outcomes through developing effective instructional leaders within elementary and high schools under the framework of distributed leadership perspective. The evaluation of the DLT is a longitudinal, cluster randomized experiment. In the 2006-07 school year, 19 eligible elementary schools were recruited and four schools were randomly assigned to the treatment group receiving the intervention. In the 2007-08 school year, seven new elementary schools were recruited. Two out of 22 schools were randomly assigned to the treatment group with twice the probabilities assigned to the original 15 control schools. This dissertation applies 2-level Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) with controlling for the baseline covariates to evaluate the two-year impact of DLT on school leadership teams (Instructional Leadership, and Leadership Data Use), teachers (Teaching Instruction, Interaction with Leader around Instruction, Interaction with Leader around Instruction, Deprivitized Practice/Peer Observation, and Teacher Data Use), and students (school attendance, math, and reading). Except the two-year impact on Deprivitized Practice/Peer Observation , which was significantly positive, no statistical significant results were found in any of the other outcome measures mentioned above at &alpha; = .05. However, the two-year impact on math was significantly negative at &alpha; = .10. In additional analyses, results based on the experimental design and a second-best non-experimental design are compared to assess the estimate bias of the non-experimental analysis. No significant difference was found from the result comparison between these two approaches.

3030578,Rest of Europe,College/University,Professional Training,"Context Medical simulation training requires effective and efficient training strategies. Dyad practice may be a training strategy worth pursuing because it has been proven effective and efficient in motor skills learning. In dyad practice two participants collaborate in learning a task they will eventually perform individually. In order to explore the effects of dyad practice in a medical simulation setting, this study examined the effectiveness and efficiency of dyad practice compared with individual practice in the learning of bronchoscopy through simulation-based training. Methods A total of 36 students of medicine were randomly assigned to either individual practice or dyad practice. The training setting included video-based instruction, 10 bronchoscopy simulator cases and instructor feedback. Participants in the dyad practice group alternated between physical and observational practice and hence physically undertook only half of the training cases undertaken by participants who practised individually. Pre-, post- and delayed (3 weeks) retention tests were used to assess skills according to previously validated simulator measures. Data were analysed using repeated-measures analysis of variance ( anova) on each dependent measure. Results A significant main effect of test was found for all measures ( F2,67 > 23.32, p  0.49), indicating parallel learning curves. Most importantly, no main effect of group was found for any of the measures, indicating no difference between learning curves ( F1,34 = 2.08, p < 0.16). Conclusions Individual practice and dyad practice did not differ in their effectiveness for the acquisition of bronchoscopy skills through supervised simulation training. However, dyad practice proved more efficient than individual practice because two participants practising in dyads learned as much as one participant practising individually but required the same instructor resources and training time as the single learner.

8154185,USA/Canada,Preschool/Kindergarten,Behaviour and Social Wellbeing,"Objective: Despite recent federal recommendations calling for increased funding for early childhood mental health consultation (ECMHC) as a means to decrease preschool expulsions, no randomized-controlled evaluations of this form of intervention have been reported in the scientific literature. This study is the first attempt to isolate the effects of ECMHC for enhancing classroom quality, decreasing teacher-rated behavior problems, and decreasing the likelihood of expulsion in targeted children in early childhood classrooms. Method: The sample consisted of 176 target children (3ï¿½4 years old) and 88 preschool classrooms and teachers randomly assigned to receive ECMHC through Connecticutï¿½s statewide Early Childhood Consultation Partnership (ECCP) or waitlist control treatment. Before randomization, teachers selected 2 target children in each classroom whose behaviors most prompted the request for ECCP. Evaluation measurements were collected before and after treatment, and child behavior and social skills and overall quality of the childcare environment were assessed. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to evaluate the effectiveness of ECCP and to account for the nested structure of the study design. Results: Children who received ECCP had significantly lower ratings of hyperactivity, restlessness, externalizing behaviors, problem behaviors, and total problems compared with children in the control group even after controlling for gender and pretest scores. No effects were found on likelihood of expulsion and quality of childcare environment. Conclusion: ECCP resulted in significant decreases across several domains of teacher-rated externalizing and problem behaviors and is a viable and potentially cost-effective means for infusing mental health services into early childhood settings. Clinical and policy implications for ECMHC are discussed.

The two school feeding programs under consideration are, on the one hand, school meals where students are provided with lunch each school day, and, on the other hand, take-home rations that provide girls with 10 kg of cereal flour each month, conditional on 90 percent attendance rate. After running for one academic year, both programs increased girls' enrollment by 5 to 6 percentage points. While there was no observable significant impact on raw scores in mathematics, the time-adjusted scores in mathematics improved slightly for girls. The interventions caused absenteeism to increase in households that were low in child labor supply while absenteeism decreased for households that had a relatively large child labor supply, consistent with the labor constraints. Finally, for younger siblings of beneficiaries, aged between 12 and 60 months, take-home rations have increased weight-for-age by .38 standard deviations and weight-for-height by .33 standard deviations.

The aim of this randomised controlled trial was to upscale a recent study by Miller and Robertson investigating the effects of a commercial off-the-shelf computer game on children's mental computation skills and self-perceptions. A pre-post design was employed, with 634 primary (elementary) school children (10-11 years old) from 32 schools across Scotland. Schools were randomly assigned to experimental or control conditions. In the experimental schools, children used a games console for 20 minutes each day, running a 'brain training' game. The controls continued with their normal routine. The treatment period was 9 weeks. Significant pre-post gains in accuracy and speed of calculations were found in both experimental and control groups over the treatment period. Gains in the experimental group were 50% greater than those of the controls in accuracy, and twice those of the controls in speed. There were no significant changes in two measures of self-concept for either group.

3031036,USA/Canada,Preschool/Kindergarten,Literacy/English,"The effectiveness of the 'Tools of the Mind (Tools)' curriculum in improving the education of 3- and 4-year-old children was evaluated by means of a randomized trial. The 'Tools' curriculum, based on the work of Vygotsky, focuses on the development of self-regulation at the same time as teaching literacy and mathematics skills in a way that is socially mediated by peers and teachers and with a focus on play. The control group experienced an established district-created model described as a 'balanced literacy curriculum with themes.' Teachers and students were randomly assigned to either treatment or control classrooms. Children (88 'Tools' and 122 control) were compared on social behavior, language, and literacy growth. The 'Tools' curriculum was found to improve classroom quality and children's executive function as indicated by lower scores on a problem behavior scale. There were indications that Tools also improved children's language development, but these effects were smaller and did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance in multi-level models or after adjustments for multiple comparisons. Our findings indicate that a developmentally appropriate curriculum with a strong emphasis on play can enhance learning and development so as to improve both the social and academic success of young children. Moreover, it is suggested that to the extent child care commonly increases behavior problems this outcome may be reversed through the use of more appropriate curricula that actually enhance self-regulation.

Simulation-based training improves skill acquisition, but effects on patient-reported outcomes are unknown. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of a communication skills intervention for internal medicine and nurse practitioner trainees on patient- and family-reported outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized trial conducted with 391 internal medicine and 81 nurse practitioner trainees between 2007 and 2013 at the University of Washington and Medical University of South Carolina. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomized to an 8-session, simulation-based, communication skills intervention (N?=?232) or usual education (N?=?240). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcome was patient-reported quality of communication (QOC; mean rating of 17 items rated from 0-10, with 0?=?poor and 10?=?perfect). Secondary outcomes were patient-reported quality of end-of-life care (QEOLC; mean rating of 26 items rated from 0-10) and depressive symptoms (assessed using the 8-item Personal Health Questionnaire [PHQ-8]; range, 0-24, higher scores worse) and family-reported QOC and QEOLC. Analyses were clustered by trainee. RESULTS: There were 1866 patient ratings (44% response) and 936 family ratings (68% response). The intervention was not associated with significant changes in QOC or QEOLC. Mean values for postintervention patient QOC and QEOLC were 6.5 (95% CI, 6.2 to 6.8) and 8.3 (95% CI, 8.1 to 8.5) respectively, compared with 6.3 (95% CI, 6.2 to 6.5) and 8.3 (95% CI, 8.1 to 8.4) for control conditions.

3030925,UK/Ireland,Primary/Elementary,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"Objective To investigate the effectiveness of a school based intervention to increase physical activity, reduce sedentary behaviour, and increase fruit and vegetable consumption in children. Design Cluster randomised controlled trial. Setting 60 primary schools in the south west of England. Participants Primary school children who were in school year 4 (age 8-9 years) at recruitment and baseline assessment, in year 5 during the intervention, and at the end of year 5 (age 9-10) at follow-up assessment. Intervention The Active for Life Year 5 (AFLY5) intervention consisted of teacher training, provision of lesson and child-parent interactive homework plans, all materials required for lessons and homework, and written materials for school newsletters and parents. The intervention was delivered when children were in school year 5 (age 9-10 years). Schools allocated to control received standard teaching. Main outcome measures The pre-specified primary outcomes were accelerometer assessed minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity per day, accelerometer assessed minutes of sedentary behaviour per day, and reported daily consumption of servings of fruit and vegetables. Results 60 schools with more than 2221 children were recruited; valid data were available for fruit and vegetable consumption for 2121 children, for accelerometer assessed physical activity and sedentary behaviour for 1252 children, and for secondary outcomes for between 1825 and 2212 children for the main analyses. None of the three primary outcomes differed between children in schools allocated to the AFLY5 intervention and those allocated to the control group. The difference in means comparing the intervention group with the control group was -1.35 (95% confidence interval -5.29 to 2.59) minutes per day for moderate to vigorous physical activity, -0.11 (-9.71 to 9.49) minutes per day for sedentary behaviour, and 0.08 (-0.12 to 0.28) servings per day for fruit and vegetable consumption. The intervention was effective for three out of nine of the secondary outcomes after multiple testing was taken into account: self reported time spent in screen viewing at the weekend (-21 (-37 to -4) minutes per day), self reported servings of snacks per day (-0.22 (-0.38 to -0.05)), and servings of high energy drinks per day (-0.26 (-0.43 to -0.10)) were all reduced. Results from a series of sensitivity analyses testing different assumptions about missing data and from per protocol analyses produced similar results. Conclusion The findings suggest that the AFLY5 school based intervention is not effective at increasing levels of physical activity, decreasing sedentary behaviour, and increasing fruit and vegetable consumption in primary school children. Change in these activities may require more intensive behavioural interventions with children or upstream interventions at the family and societal level, as well as at the school environment level. These findings have relevance for researchers, policy makers, public health practitioners, and doctors who are involved in health promotion, policy making, and commissioning services.","Effect of intervention aimed at increasing physical activity, reducing sedentary behaviour, and increasing fruit and vegetable consumption in children: Active for Life Year 5 (AFLY5) school based cluster randomised controlled trial",NA,2014,Universal,Regular Teachers/Lecturers,More than One Term,None,None,Clustered,2221,60,No,Whole Sample Only,Immediate Post-Test Only,Yes,No,"Yes, Descriptive Theory of Change",Yes,UK/Ireland Primary/Elementary Physical Health and Wellbeing

This study population included two independent first-semester courses with enrollments of about 600. Achievement was measured by scores on exams written by an instructor blind to student participation. Established instruments were used to assess changes in attitude to chemistry and self-concept as a chemistry learner. No differences were found in achievement, attitude, or self-concept for students who participated in PLTL vs. those who participated in documented alternative study activities. Overall, certain aspects of attitude and self-concept showed a slight but significant decline from beginning to end of semester, consistent with previous studies. Males have higher positive attitude and self-concept than females, and first-year students have higher positive attitude, self-concept, and achievement than non first-year students. In a quasi-experimental comparison of 10 other course sections over seven years, students who self-selected into PLTL showed stronger exam achievement than those who did not choose to participate. These findings suggest that past reports of improved student performance with PLTL may in part be a consequence of attracting students who are already motivated to take advantage of its value.","Effect of Peer-Led Team Learning (PLTL) on Student Achievement, Attitude, and Self-Concept in College General Chemistry in Randomized and Quasi Experimental Designs","https://www.google.com/search?q=Effect+of+Peer-Led+Team+Learning+(PLTL)+on+Student+Achievement,+Attitude,+and+Self-Concept+in+College+General+Chemistry+in+Randomized+and+Quasi+Experimental+Designs",2015,Universal,Regular Teachers/Lecturers,Between Half and Full Term,None,None,Single,297,NA,no,Some Sub-Groups Reported,Immediate Post-Test Only,Yes,No,"Yes, Descriptive Theory of Change",Yes,USA/Canada College/University Study-Related Skills

Design: Cluster randomized, investigator masked, controlled trial. Setting: 252 primary schools in two prefectures in western China, 2012-13. Participants: 3177 of 19 934 children in fourth and fifth grades (mean age 10.5 years) with visual acuity  6/12 with glasses. 3052 (96.0%) completed the study. Interventions: Children were randomized by school (84 schools per arm) to one of three interventions at the beginning of the school year: prescription for glasses only (control group), vouchers for free glasses at a local facility, or free glasses provided in class. Main outcome measures: Spectacle wear at endline examination and end of year score on a specially designed mathematics test, adjusted for baseline score and expressed in standard deviations. Results: Among 3177 eligible children, 1036 (32.6%) were randomized to control, 988 (31.1%) to vouchers, and 1153 (36.3%) to free glasses in class. All eligible children would benefit from glasses, but only 15% wore them at baseline. At closeout glasses wear was 41% (observed) and 68% (self reported) in the free glasses group, and 26% (observed) and 37% (self reported) in the controls. Effect on test score was 0.11 SD (95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.21) when the free glasses group was compared with the control group. The adjusted effect of providing free glasses (0.10, 0.002 to 0.19) was greater than parental education (0.03, &minus;0.04 to 0.09) or family wealth (0.01, &minus;0.06 to 0.08). This difference between groups was significant, but was smaller than the prespecified 0.20 SD difference that the study was powered to detect. Conclusions: The provision of free glasses to Chinese children with myopia improves childrenï¿½s performance on mathematics testing to a statistically significant degree, despite imperfect compliance, although the observed difference between groups was smaller than the study was originally designed to detect.

DESIGN: Cluster randomised controlled trial. SETTING: 28 classes from 15 elementary schools in Switzerland randomly selected and assigned in a 4:3 ratio to an intervention (n=16) or control arm (n=12) after stratification for grade (first and fifth grade), from August 2005 to June 2006. PARTICIPANTS: 540 children, of whom 502 consented and presented at baseline. INTERVENTION: Children in the intervention arm (n=297) received a multi-component physical activity programme that included structuring the three existing physical education lessons each week and adding two additional lessons a week, daily short activity breaks, and physical activity homework. Children (n=205) and parents in the control group were not informed of an intervention group. For most outcome measures, the assessors were blinded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome measures included body fat (sum of four skinfolds), aerobic fitness (shuttle run test), physical activity (accelerometry), and quality of life (questionnaires). Secondary outcome measures included body mass index and cardiovascular risk score (average z score of waist circumference, mean blood pressure, blood glucose, inverted high density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides). RESULTS: 498 children completed the baseline and follow-up assessments (mean age 6.9 (SD 0.3) years for first grade, 11.1 (0.5) years for fifth grade).

Laparoscopic training programs for acquisition of surgical skills are widely spread, but implementation of such 3D systems is scarce. In this prospective randomized controlled trial we evaluated the effect of a third visual dimension on the performance of trainees without laparoscopic skills in a laparoscopy training setup. Methods: 40 in laparoscopy unexperienced medical students and doctors were randomly grouped into a 2D system training and a 3D system training. The same standardized tasks were carried out by both groups and a learning curve for each group was obtained. After absolving the training the 3D group also carried out the tasks under 2-dimensional vision. Precision, processing time and rounds till learning curve plateau reached' were the parameters obtained. Results: At the end of the training processing time was significantly slower under 2D than under 3D vision (median: 78.7 vs. 108.3 s; interquartile range (IQR): 19.6 vs. 108.3 s; p = 0.0049). results in precision were better within the 3D group, but no significance was measured (p = 0.49). The plateau of the learning curve was reached faster with 3D than under 2-dimensional training. Carrying out the tasks under 2-dimensional vision after absolving the training in 3D the test persons showed faster processing time than in the 2D group's final training results. Conclusions: Implementation of 3-dimensional view leads to faster acquisition of laparoscopic skills and faster processing time of standardized laparoscopic tasks. It does not significantly improve precision. Still, the test persons had a benefit of being trained under 3D vision even after switching to 2D.

The sample consisted of 156 children randomly assigned at the school level into an experimental (80 children) and control condition (76 children). In addition, 131 mothers and 76 fathers participated in the study. Four assessments took place: a pretest, a posttest, and two follow-up assessments conducted 6 months and 1 year after finishing KIDS. Latent growth analyses demonstrated that the intervention significantly reduced child-reported emotional problems and enhanced child-reported communication with the father and mother-reported communication with the child. The effect sizes ranged from .30ï¿½.63. Few moderation effects of gender, time since divorce, or perceived parental conflict on the intervention effects were found.

These two approaches were then measured against a 'psycho-social profile' which is based on material conditions and the developmental stages of the children. Instructions were given to the experimental group on how to brush their teeth. They were supervised, reinforced and stimulated for a period of six months, with a post-test assessment. The control group was only given instructions on how to brush their teeth and supervised. A scale based on Massler's classification was used to determine the developmental stages. Standardized indices were used to evaluate the dependent variable: Plaque Index and Gingival Index. The results showed that: the material living conditions and developmental stage of the child are elements that influence the assimilation of pre-established behavior, the basis of preventive programs.",Effectiveness educational programs for school dental health.

8155235,Rest of Europe,Middle/High School,Behaviour and Social Wellbeing,"Problematic substance use and mental health problems often co-occur in adolescents. Effective school-based interventions that are brief and target multiple problems are promising in the field of health promotion. Preventure is a brief, school-based, selective preventive intervention, tailored to four personality profiles. Preventure has already proved effective on alcohol outcomes. Previous trials also reveal effects on several mental health outcomes, yet the evidence for these outcomes is limited. This study presents the results of the Dutch Preventure Trial, on a range of mental health outcomes. In a cluster RCT, including 699 high risk students (mean age 14 years), the intervention effects on mental health problems at 2, 6, and 12 months post intervention were tested in the total high risk population and in four specific personality groups. No significant intervention effects were found on 22 from the 24 tests. A positive intervention effect on anxiety was found in the anxiety sensitivity personality group at 12-month follow-up, and a negative intervention effect on depression was found at 12-month follow-up in the negative thinking group. In post hoc growth curve analyses these effects were not found. This study found no convincing evidence for the effectiveness of Preventure in The Netherlands on mental health problems. This finding is not in line with the results of an earlier effectiveness study in the UK. This highlights the need for more research into the knowledge transfer model of interventions, to ensure that interventions are effective in a variety of circumstances.

The objective of this study was to test the effectiveness of a modified version of the Dementia module of the Continuum curriculum, adapted for medical students rotating on their neurology clerkship, in increasing medical knowledge of dementia. METHODS: A multisite longitudinal randomized controlled design was used. Medical students rotating on their Neurology clerkship were recruited from 2 US medical schools. Participants completed 10 multiple-choice questions, 1 fill-in-the-blank, and 1 patient case simulation question to assess medical knowledge of the most prevalent dementias pre- and post-curriculum implementation. All students received their standard dementia curriculum (45-minute live didactic presentation on dementia along with a copy of the slides in handout form). Students were randomized to either the intervention (standard + Continuum curriculum) or control (standard curriculum alone) group. Data collection and outcomes assessment was optimized via an interactive audience response system (pretest) and Web-based survey/database tool (post-test and student satisfaction surveys). RESULTS: From pre- to post-clinical clerkship, medical students completing the Continuum dementia curriculum in addition to standard clerkship curriculum demonstrated significantly greater increases in medical knowledge of dementia, relative to students completing only the standard curriculum. Subscores were significantly higher among Continuum-trained students on questions regarding Alzheimer disease (AD), frontotemporal lobar dementia, Lewy body dementia, AD treatment fill-in-the-blank, and AD patient case simulation. CONCLUSIONS: The Continuum: Dementia for Medical Students curriculum provided an inexpensive and readily implementable means for improving medical knowledge of dementia.

DESIGN: Paired cluster randomized school-based trial conducted with a sample of fifth graders. SETTING: Twenty classes were randomly assigned into either an intervention group or a control group. PARTICIPANTS: From a total of 574 eligible students, 559 students participated in the study (intervention: 10 classes with 277 participants; control: 10 classes with 282 participants). The mean age of students was 11 years. INTERVENTION: Students attended 9 nutritional education sessions during the 2010 academic year. Parents/guardians and teachers received information on the same subjects. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENT: Changes in BMI and percentage of body fat. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analysis showed that changes in BMI were not significantly different between the 2 groups (??=?0.003; p?=?0.75). There was a major reduction in the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and cookies in the intervention group; students in this group also consumed more fruits.

METHOD: A total of 127 war-exposed and predominantly ethnic Muslim secondary school students attending 10 schools in central Bosnia who reported severe symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, or maladaptive grief and significant impairment in school or relationships were randomly assigned to one of two experimental conditions. These included either an active-treatment comparison condition (tier 1), consisting of a classroom-based psychoeducation and skills intervention alone (n = 61, 66% girls, mean age 16.0 years, SD 1.13) or a treatment condition composed of both the classroom-based intervention and a 17-session manual-based group therapy intervention (tier 2), trauma and grief component therapy for adolescents (n = 66, 63% girls, mean age 15.9 years, SD 1.11). Both interventions were implemented throughout the school year. Distressed students who were excluded from the study due to acute risk for harm (n = 9) were referred for community-based mental health services (tier 3). RESULTS: Program effectiveness was measured via reductions in symptoms of PTSD, depression, and maladaptive grief assessed at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 4-month follow-up. Analysis of mean-level treatment effects showed significant pre- to posttreatment and posttreatment to 4-month follow-up reductions in PTSD and depression symptoms in both the treatment and comparison conditions. Significant pre- to posttreatment reductions in maladaptive grief reactions were found only in the treatment condition. Analyzed at the individual case level, the percentages of students in the treatment condition who reported significant (p <.05) pre- to posttreatment reductions in PTSD symptoms (58% at posttreatment, 81% at 4-month follow-up) compare favorably to those reported in controlled treatment efficacy trials, whereas the percentages who reported significant reductions in depression symptoms (23% at posttreatment, 61% at follow-up) are comparable to, or higher than, those found in community treatment settings. Lower but substantial percentages of significant symptom reduction were found for PTSD (33% at posttreatment, 48% at follow-up) and depression symptoms (13% at posttreatment; 47% at follow-up) in students in the comparison condition. The odds of significant symptom reduction were higher for PTSD symptoms at both posttreatment and 4-month follow-up and for maladaptive grief at posttreatment (no follow-up was conducted on maladaptive grief). Rates of significantly worsened cases were generally rare in both the treatment and comparison conditions.

The study includes 2,210 children aged 10-12 years.The iPlay-intervention takes one school year and consists of a teacher manual, informative newsletters and posters, a website, and simple exercises to be carried out during physical education classes.Outcomes measures were self-reported injury preventing behavior, self-reported behavioral determinants (knowledge, attitude, social-influence, self-efficacy, and intention), and neuromotor fitness.Results: The iPlay-program was not able to significantly improve injury-preventing behavior. The program did significantly improve knowledge and attitude, two determinants of behavior. The effect of the intervention-program on behavior appeared to be significantly mediated by knowledge and attitude.

8154369,Rest of Europe,Middle/High School,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"Background
Physical activity is associated not only with health-related parameters, but also with cognitive
and academic performance. However, no large scale school-based physical activity
interventions have investigated effects on cognitive performance in adolescents. The aim of
this study was to describe the effectiveness of a school-based physical activity intervention
in enhancing cognitive performance in 12–14 years old adolescents.
Methods
A 20 week cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted including seven intervention
and seven control schools. A total of 632 students (mean (SD) age: 12.9 (0.6) years) completed
the trial with baseline and follow-up data on primary or secondary outcomes (74% of
randomized subjects). The intervention targeted physical activity during academic subjects,
recess, school transportation and leisure-time. Cognitive performance was assessed using
an executive functions test of inhibition (flanker task) with the primary outcomes being accuracy
and reaction time on congruent and incongruent trials. Secondary outcomes included
mathematics performance, physical activity levels, body-mass index, waist-circumference
and cardiorespiratory fitness.
Results
No significant difference in change, comparing the intervention group to the control group,
was observed on the primary outcomes (p’s>0.05) or mathematics skills (p>0.05). An intervention effect was found for cardiorespiratory fitness in girls (21 meters (95% CI: 4.4–
38.6) and body-mass index in boys (-0.22 kg/m2 (95% CI: -0.39–0.05). Contrary to our predictions,
a significantly larger change in interference control for reaction time was found in
favor of the control group (5.0 milliseconds (95% CI: 0–9). Baseline to mid-intervention
changes in physical activity levels did not differ significantly between groups (all p’s>0.05).
Conclusions
No evidence was found for effectiveness of a 20-week multi-faceted school-based physical
activity intervention for enhancing executive functioning or mathematics skills compared to
a control group, but low implementation fidelity precludes interpretation of the causal
relationship.","Effectiveness of a School-Based Physical

OBJECTIVES: To report 24-month outcomes of the Teacher-Delivered Personality-Targeted Interventions for Substance Misuse Trial (Adventure trial) in which school staff were trained to provide interventions to students with 1 of 4 high-risk (HR) profiles: anxiety sensitivity, hopelessness, impulsivity, and sensation seeking and to examine the indirect herd effects of this program on the broader low-risk (LR) population of students who were not selected for intervention. DESIGN: Cluster randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Secondary schools in London, United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1210 HR and 1433 LR students in the ninth grade (mean [SD] age, 13.7 [0.33] years). INTERVENTION: Schools were randomized to provide brief personality-targeted interventions to HR youth or treatment as usual (statutory drug education in class). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants were assessed for drinking, binge drinking, and problem drinking before randomization and at 6-monthly intervals for 2 years. RESULTS: Two-part latent growth models indicated long-term effects of the intervention on drinking rates (? = -0.320, SE = 0.145, P = .03) and binge drinking rates (? = -0.400, SE = 0.179, P = .03) and growth in binge drinking (? = -0.716, SE = 0.274, P = .009) and problem drinking (? = -0.452, SE = 0.193, P = .02) for HR youth. The HR youth were also found to benefit from the interventions during the 24-month follow-up on drinking quantity (? = -0.098, SE = 0.047, P = .04), growth in drinking quantity (? = -0.176, SE = 0.073, P = .02), and growth in binge drinking frequency (? = -0.183, SE = 0.092, P = .047). Some herd effects in LR youth were observed, specifically on drinking rates (? = -0.259, SE = 0.132, P = .049) and growth of binge drinking (? = -0.244, SE = 0.073, P = .001), during the 24-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Findings further support the personality-targeted approach to alcohol prevention and its effectiveness when provided by trained school staff.

Methods: A cluster-randomised controlled trial was carried out in areas with low to medium socio-economic status. Participants were six-year-old children (n = 243) and their parents. Fourteen pre-school classes were randomly assigned to intervention (n = 7) and control groups (n = 7). The intervention lasted for 6 months and included: 1) Health information for parents, 2) Motivational Interviewing with parents and 3) Teacher-led classroom activities with children. Physical activity was measured by accelerometry, dietary and physical activity habits and parental self-efficacy through a questionnaire. Body weight and height were measured and BMI standard deviation score was calculated. Measurements were conducted at baseline, post-intervention and at 6-months follow-up. Group differences were examined using analysis of covariance and Poisson regression, adjusted for gender and baseline values. Results: There was no significant intervention effect in the primary outcome physical activity. Subgroup analyses showed a significant gender-group interaction in total physical activity (TPA), with girls in the intervention group demonstrating higher TPA during weekends (p = 0.04), as well as in sedentary time, with boys showing more sedentary time in the intervention group (p = 0.03). There was a significantly higher vegetable intake (0.26 servings) in the intervention group compared to the control group (p = 0.003). At follow-up, sub-group analyses showed a sustained effect for boys. The intervention did not affect the prevalence of overweight or obesity. Conclusions: It is possible to influence vegetable intake in children and girls' physical activity through a parental support programme. The programme needs to be intensified in order to increase effectiveness and sustain the effects long-term. These findings are an important contribution to the further development of evidence-based parental support programmes to prevent overweight and obesity in children.","Effectiveness of a universal parental support programme to promote healthy dietary habits and physical activity and to prevent overweight and obesity in 6-year-old children: The healthy school start study, a cluster-randomised controlled trial",NA,2015,Universal,Regular Teachers/Lecturers,Between Half and Full Term,Physical Health and Wellbeing,none,Clustered,243,14,Yes,Some Sub-Groups Reported,At Least Some Follow-Up,Yes,"Yes, Fairly Well","Yes, Descriptive Theory of Change",Yes,Rest of Europe Preschool/Kindergarten Behaviour and Social Wellbeing
3031106,USA/Canada,Primary/Elementary,Behaviour and Social Wellbeing,"OBJECTIVE: To determine if a commonly used violence prevention curriculum, Second Step: A Violence Prevention Curriculum, leads to a reduction in aggressive behavior and an increase in prosocial behavior among elementary school students. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Urban and suburban elementary schools in the state of Washington. PARTICIPANTS: Six matched pairs of schools with 790 second-grade and third-grade students. The students were 53% male and 79% white. INTERVENTION: The curriculum uses 30 specific lessons to teach social skills related to anger management, impulse control, and empathy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Aggressive and prosocial behavior changes were measured 2 weeks and 6 months after participation in the curriculum by parent and teacher reports (Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist and Teacher Report Form, the School Social Behavior Scale, and the Parent-Child Rating Scale) and by observation of a random subsample of 588 students in the classroom and playground/cafeteria settings. RESULTS: After adjusting for sex, age, socioeconomic status, race, academic performance, household size, and class size, change scores did not differ significantly between the intervention and control schools for any of the parent-reported or teacher-reported behavior scales. However, the behavior observations did reveal an overall decrease 2 weeks after the curriculum in physical aggression (P=.03) and an increase in neutral/prosocial behavior (P=.04) in the intervention group compared with the control group.

3031565,Rest of Europe,Middle/High School,Behaviour and Social Wellbeing,"Background: To promote well-being and health behaviors among adolescents, 2 interventions were implemented at 12 secondary schools. Adolescents in the E-health4Uth group received Web-based tailored messages focused on their health behaviors and well-being. Adolescents in the E-health4Uth and consultation group received the same tailored messages, but were subsequently referred to a school nurse for a consultation if they were at risk of mental health problems. Objective: This study evaluated the effect of E-health4Uth and E-health4Uth and consultation on well-being (ie, mental health status and health-related quality of life) and health behaviors (ie, alcohol and drug use, smoking, safe sex). Methods: A cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted among third- and fourth-year secondary school students (mean age 15.9, SD 0.69). School classes (clusters) were randomly assigned to (1) E-health4Uth group, (2) E-health4Uth and consultation group, or (3) control group (ie, care as usual). Adolescents completed a questionnaire at baseline and at 4-month follow-up assessing alcohol consumption, smoking, drug use, condom use, mental health via the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and the Youth Self Report (YSR; only measured at follow-up), and health-related quality of life. Multilevel logistic, ordinal, and linear regression analyses were used to reveal differences in health behavior and well-being between the intervention groups and the control group at follow-up. Subsequently, it was explored whether demographics moderated the effects. Results: Data from 1256 adolescents were analyzed. Compared to the control intervention, the E-health4Uth intervention, as a standalone intervention, showed minor positive results in health-related quality of life (B = 2.79, 95% CI 0.72-4.87) and condom use during intercourse among adolescents of Dutch ethnicity (OR 3.59, 95% CI 1.71-7.55) not replicated in the E-health4Uth and consultation group. The E-health4Uth and consultation intervention showed minor positive results in the mental health status of adolescents (SDQ: B = &minus;0.60, 95% CI &minus;1.17 to &minus;0.04), but a negative effect on drug use among boys (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.13-0.96). In the subgroup of adolescents who were at risk of mental health problems at baseline (and referred for a consultation with the nurse), the E-health4Uth and consultation group showed minor to moderate positive results in mental health status (SDQ: B = &minus;1.79, 95% CI &minus;3.35 to &minus;0.22; YSR: B = &minus;9.11, 95% CI &minus;17.52 to &minus;0.71) and health-related quality of life (B = 7.81, 95% CI 2.41-13.21) at follow-up compared to adolescents in the control group who were at risk of mental health problems at baseline. Conclusions: Findings from this study support the use of the E-health4Uth and consultation intervention in promoting the well-being of adolescents at risk of mental health problems.

3031197,Rest of Europe,Primary/Elementary,Behaviour and Social Wellbeing,"Background: For elementary school-children with aggressive behaviour problems, there is a strong need for effective preventive interventions to interrupt the developmental trajectory towards more serious behaviour problems. Aim: The aim of this RCT-study was to evaluate a school-based individual tailor-made intervention (Stay Cool Kids), designed to reduce aggressive behaviour in selected children by enhancing cognitive behavioural skills. Method: The sample consisted of 48 schools, with 264 fourth-grade children selected by their teachers because of elevated levels of externalizing behaviour (TRF T-score > 60), randomly assigned to the intervention or no-intervention control condition. Results: The intervention was found to be effective in reducing reactive and proactive aggressive behaviour as reported by children, mothers, fathers or teachers, with effect sizes ranging from .11 to .32. Clinically relevant changes in teacher-rated externalizing behaviour were found: the intervention reduced behaviour problems to (sub) clinical or normative levels for significantly more children than the control condition. Some aspects of problems in social cognitive functioning were reduced and children showed more positive self-perception. Ethnic background and gender moderated intervention effects on child and teacher reported aggression and child response generation.

3031304,Asia,College/University,Professional Training,"BACKGROUND: The first step toward increasing the level of patient safety in endoscopic surgery is for all endoscopic surgeons to acquire fundamental skills, including psychomotor skills, in the preoperation stage of training. The current study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) simulator training and box training for training the fundamental skills of endoscopic surgery. METHODS: For this study, 35 medical students at Kyushu University were divided into three groups: simulator (SIM) group (n = 20), box trainer (BOX) group (n = 20), and control group (n = 15). None of the students had any experience assisting with endoscopic surgery or any previous training for endoscopic surgery. The students in the SIM group underwent training using a VR simulator, the Procedicus MIST, 2 h per day for 2 days. The students in the BOX group underwent training using a box trainer 2 h per day for 2 days. The students in the control group watched an educational video for 30 min. The endoscopic surgical skills of all the students were evaluated before and after training with a task of suturing and knot tying using a box trainer. RESULTS: Although no significant differences were found between the three groups in the total time taken to complete the evaluation task before training, there were significant improvements in the SIM and BOX groups after training compared with the control group. Box training increased errors during the task, but simulator training did not. CONCLUSION: The findings showed that box training and VR training have different outcomes.

DESIGN: Block randomized trial, matched for age and gross motor function. SETTING: Coordinated, multinational study (Israel, Jordan and Palestinian Authority) in schools and rehabilitation centers. SUBJECTS: 78 children with spastic cerebral palsy, gross motor functional levels II and III, aged 66 to 146 months. INTERVENTIONS: 1 hr/day, 3 days/week for 3 months treatment with motor learning coaching or neurodevelopmental treatment: two groups. MAIN MEASURES: Gross motor function Measure (GMFM-66), stair-climbing mechanical efficiency (ME) and parent questionnaire rating their child's mobility. Immediate treatment effects were assessed after 3 months and retention determined from follow-up measurements 6 months after treatment. RESULTS: GMFM-66, ME and parent questionnaires were obtained from 65, 31 and 64 subjects, respectively. Although both groups increased GMFM-66 score over 3 months, measurements 6 months later indicated retention was significantly superior by 2.7 in the motor learning coaching children of level-II. Similar retention trend was evident for ME, increasing 6 months after motor learning coaching by 1.1% and declining 0.3% after neurodevelopmental treatment. Mobility performance in the outdoors and community environment increased 13% from 3 to 9 months after motor learning coaching and decreased 12% after neurodevelopmental treatment.

3031587,Central/South America,Primary/Elementary,Literacy/English,"Introduction: Difficulties in word-level reading skills are prevalent in Brazilian schools and may deter children from gaining the knowledge obtained through reading and academic achievement. Music education has emerged as a potential method to improve reading skills because due to a common neurobiological substratum. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of music education for the improvement of reading skills and academic achievement among children (eight to 10 years of age) with reading difficulties. Method: 235 children with reading difficulties in 10 schools participated in a five-month, randomized clinical trial in cluster (RCT) in an impoverished zone within the city of Sao Paulo to test the effects of music education intervention while assessing reading skills and academic achievement during the school year. Five schools were chosen randomly to incorporate music classes (n = 114), and five served as controls (n = 121). Two different methods of analysis were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention: The standard method was intention-to-treat (ITT), and the other was the Complier Average Causal Effect (CACE) estimation method, which took compliance status into account. Results: The ITT analyses were not very promising; only one marginal effect existed for the rate of correct real words read per minute. Indeed, considering ITT, improvements were observed in the secondary outcomes (slope of Portuguese = 0.21 [p<0.001] and slope of math = 0.25 [p<0.001]). As for CACE estimation (i.e., complier children versus non-complier children), more promising effects were observed in terms of the rate of correct words read per minute [beta = 13.98, p<0.001] and phonological awareness [beta = 19.72, p<0.001] as well as secondary outcomes (academic achievement in Portuguese [beta = 0.77, p<0.0001] and math [beta = 0.49, p<0.001] throughout the school year). Conclusion: The results may be seen as promising, but they are not, in themselves, enough to make music lessons as public policy. 2013 Cogo-Moreira et al.","Effectiveness of Music Education for the Improvement of Reading Skills and Academic Achievement in Young Poor Readers: A Pragmatic Cluster-Randomized, Controlled Clinical Trial","https://www.google.com/search?q=Effectiveness+of+Music+Education+for+the+Improvement+of+Reading+Skills+and+Academic+Achievement+in+Young+Poor+Readers:+A+Pragmatic+Cluster-Randomized,+Controlled+Clinical+Trial",2013,Targeted,Regular Teachers/Lecturers,More than One Term,Range of Academic Outcomes,None,Clustered,230,10,Yes,Some Sub-Groups Reported,Immediate Post-Test Only,Yes,No,No,No,Central/South America Primary/Elementary Literacy/English

8155182,Asia,Middle/High School,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"Introduction: Oral Health Education (OHE) in schools is routinely delivered by the dentist. Another approach which can be cost-effective, easily accessible and equally effective is the trained group of peer students. Aim: The objective of the present study was to assess and compare the effectiveness of peer-led and conventional method (dentist-led), OHE on oral health status, oral health knowledge, attitude and practices among 12-15 year old government school children in Bengaluru South Zone-I at baseline, 3 months and 6 months. Materials and Methods: The study population comprised of 450 subjects, 150 each in peer, dentist and control group. At baseline, a pre-tested 14 item questionnaire was used to assess the existing oral health knowledge, attitude and oral hygiene practices of the subjects. Clinical examination included recording of plaque index and gingival index, by a pre-calibrated examiner. OHE was provided by the peer group and dentist (using power-point presentation, chalk and talk presentation, using charts, posters, booklets and tooth brushing demonstration models). Data was analyzed using Kruskal Wallis and Chi-square test. Results: Both the peer-led and dentist-led OHE intervention were effective in improving oral health knowledge, attitude, oral hygiene practices and oral health status at three and six months when compared to control group. The adolescents in the peer-led group, however, exhibited statistically better oral health behavior than their counterparts in the dentist-led group and control group.

3031267,Rest of Europe,Middle/High School,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"BACKGROUND: Substance use is highly prevalent among Dutch adolescents. The Healthy School and Drugs program is a nationally implemented school-based prevention program aimed at reducing early and excessive substance use among adolescents. Although the program's effectiveness was tested in a quasi-experimental design before, many program changes were made afterwards. The present study, therefore, aims to test the effects of this widely used, renewed universal prevention program. METHODS/DESIGN: A randomized clustered trial will be conducted among 3,784 adolescents of 23 secondary schools in The Netherlands. The trial has three conditions; two intervention conditions (i.e., e-learning and integral) and a control condition. The e-learning condition consists of three digital learning modules (i.e., about alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana) that are sequentially offered over the course of three school years (i.e., grade 1, grade 2, and grade 3). The integral condition consists of parental participation in a parental meeting on substance use, regulation of substance use, and monitoring and counseling of students' substance use at school, over and above the three digital modules. The control condition is characterized as business as usual. Participating schools were randomly assigned to either an intervention or control condition.Participants filled out a digital questionnaire at baseline and will fill out the same questionnaire three more times at follow-up measurements (8, 20, and 32 months after baseline). Outcome variables included in the questionnaire are the percentage of binge drinking (more than five drinks per occasion), the average weekly number of drinks, and the percentage of adolescents who ever drunk a glass of alcohol and the percentage of adolescents who ever smoked a cigarette or a joint respectively for tobacco and marijuana. DISCUSSION: This study protocol describes the design of a randomized clustered trial that evaluates the effectiveness of a school-based prevention program.

Method: Three hundred seventy-eight adolescents (M age = 15.5, SD = 1.2; 68% female, 72% White) with elevated self-assessed depressive symptoms who were randomized to CB group, CB bibliotherapy, or educational brochure control were assessed at pretest, posttest, and 6-, 12-, 18-, and 24-month follow-up. Results: By 2 years postintervention, CB group participants showed significantly lower major depressive disorder (MDD) onset versus CB bibliotherapy (10% vs. 25%, respectively; hazard ratio = 2.48, p = .006), but the incidence difference relative to brochure controls (17%) was nonsignificant; MDD incidence for bibliotherapy and brochure controls did not differ. Although CB group participants showed lower depressive symptoms at posttest versus brochure controls, there were no effects for this outcome or for social adjustment or substance use over 2-year follow-up. Moderator analyses suggested that participants with higher baseline depressive symptoms showed greater long-term symptom reductions in the CB group intervention versus bibliotherapy. Conclusions: The evidence that a brief CB group intervention delivered by real-world providers significantly reduced MDD onset versus CB bibliotherapy is potentially encouraging. However, the lack of MDD prevention effects relative to brochure control and lack of long-term symptom effects (though consistent with results from other depression prevention trials), suggest that the delivery of the CB group should be refined to strengthen its effectiveness.

DESIGN: Cluster randomized trial. SETTING: Twelve metropolitan Chicago, Ill, schools and the communities they serve, 1994 through 1998. PARTICIPANTS: Students in grades 5 through 8 and their parents and teachers. INTERVENTIONS: The social development curriculum (SDC) consisted of 16 to 21 lessons per year focusing on social competence skills necessary to manage situations in which high-risk behaviors occur. The school/community intervention (SCI) consisted of SDC and school-wide climate and parent and community components. The control group received an attention-placebo health enhancement curriculum (HEC) of equal intensity to the SDC focusing on nutrition, physical activity, and general health care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Student self-reports of violence, provocative behavior, school delinquency, substance use, and sexual behaviors (intercourse and condom use). RESULTS: For boys, the SDC and SCI significantly reduced the rate of increase in violent behavior (by 35% and 47% compared with HEC, respectively), provoking behavior (41% and 59%), school delinquency (31% and 66%), drug use (32% and 34%), and recent sexual intercourse (44% and 65%), and improved the rate of increase in condom use (95% and 165%). The SCI was significantly more effective than the SDC for a combined behavioral measure (79% improvement vs 51%). There were no significant effects for girls.

3030910,Rest of Europe,Middle/High School,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"BACKGROUND: School-based interventions that target prevention of overweight and obesity in children have been tested with mixed results. Thus, successful interventions are still called for. The aim of the present study was to investigate effects of a multicomponent school-based intervention programme targeting physical activity, sedentary and dietary behaviours on anthropometric outcomes. METHODS: A 20-month intervention was evaluated in a cluster randomised, controlled study of 1324 11-year-olds. Outcome variables were body mass index (BMI), BMI-for-age z-score (BMIz), waist circumference (WC), waist-to-height ratio (WTHR) and weight status (International Obesity Task Force's cut-offs). Weight, height and WC were measured objectively; pubertal status was self-reported and parental education was self-reported by the parents. Intervention effects were determined by one-way analysis of covariance and logistic regression, after checking for clustering effects of school, and moderating effects of gender, pubertal status and parental education. RESULTS: Beneficial effects were found for BMI (p=0.02) and BMIz (p=0.003) in girls, but not in boys. While a beneficial effect was found for BMI (p=0.03) in participants of parents reporting a high level of education, a negative effect was found for WTHR in participants with parents reporting a low level of education (p=0.003). There were no intervention effects for WC and weight status. CONCLUSIONS: A multicomponent 20-month school-based intervention had a beneficial effect on BMI and BMIz in adolescent girls, but not in boys. Furthermore, children of higher educated parents seemed to benefit more from the intervention, and this needs attention in future interventions to avoid further increase in social inequalities in overweight and obesity.",Effects of a 20-month cluster randomised controlled school-based intervention trial on BMI of school-aged boys and girls: the HEIA study,https://www.google.com/search?q=Effects+of+a+20-month+cluster+randomised+controlled+school-based+intervention+trial+on+BMI+of+school-aged+boys+and+girls:+the+HEIA+study,2013,Universal,Regular Teachers/Lecturers,Full Academic Year or Longer,None,None,Clustered,1324,37,Yes,Some Sub-Groups Reported,Immediate Post-Test Only,Yes,No,"Yes, Theoretical Perspectives",Yes,Rest of Europe Middle/High School Physical Health and Wellbeing

A 5-week mindfulness-based stress management (MBSM/Mindful-Gym) program was developed to help medical students cope with stress. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention in reducing stress among students in a medical school in Malaysia. Seventy-five medical students participated in the program. They were stratified according to years of studies and randomly allocated to intervention (N = 37) and control groups (N = 38). The following outcome variables were measured at pre- and post-intervention: mindfulness (with Mindful Awareness Attention Scale); perceived stress (with Perceived Stress Scale); mental distress (with General Health Questionnaire), and self-efficacy (with General Self-efficacy Scale). Hierarchical multiple regressions were used to analyse the effect of group (intervention vs. control) on changes in the outcome variables. There were significant improvements at one week post-intervention in all outcome variables: mindfulness (&beta; = 0.19, &Delta;R2 = 0.04, p = .040, f 2 = 0.05), perceived stress (&beta; = &minus;0.26, &Delta;R2 = 0.07, p = .009, f 2 = 0.10); mental distress (&beta; = &minus;0.28, &Delta;R2 = 0.10, p = .003, f 2 = 0.15); and self-efficacy (&beta; = 0.30, &Delta;R2 = 0.09, p < .001, f 2 = 0.21).

The study comprised a cluster randomized controlled trial with three assessments (baseline, posttest, and 12-month follow-up). At baseline, a total of 2,303 sixth and seventh grade adolescents from 27 secondary schools were assessed. Of these, 1,843 (80%) could be reached at all three assessments (M age = 12.0 years; SD = 0.83). Students of the intervention group received the media literacy program Vernetzte www.Welten ('Connected www.Worlds ') implemented by trained teachers during class time. The control group attended regular class. Main outcome measures were adolescents' computer gaming and Internet use: days per month, hours per day, and addictive use patterns. Parental media monitoring and rules at home were assessed as secondary outcomes. Results of multilevel growth-curve models revealed a significant intervention effect in terms of a lower increase in self-reported gaming frequency (&beta; = &minus;1.10 [95% CI &minus;2.06, &minus;0.13]), gaming time (&beta; = &minus;0.27 [95% CI &minus;0.40, &minus;0.14]), and proportion of excessive gamers (AOR = 0.21 [95% CI 0.08, 0.57]) in the intervention group.

Objective To evaluate the effect of a free school breakfast programme on children's school attendance, academic achievement and short-term hunger. Design A stepped-wedge, cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted. Schools were randomised to cross over from control to intervention phase (i.e. one-way switch over) in different terms during a full school year. Setting: 14 New Zealand schools (decile 1-4). Participants: 424 children, mean age 9.4 + 2 years, 53% female, 34% Maori, 42% Pacific, 23% New Zealand European/Other ethnicities. Intervention: A free daily school breakfast programme. Outcome measures: The primary outcome was children's school attendance. Secondary outcomes were academic achievement; self-reported grades; sense of belonging at school; behaviour; short-term hunger; breakfast habits; and food security. Results There was no statistically significant effect of the breakfast programme on children's school attendance. The odds of children achieving an attendance rate <95% was 0.76 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56, 1.02) during the intervention phase, and 0.93 (95% CI 0.67, 1.31) during the control phase, giving an odds ratio of 0.81 (95% CI 0.59, 1.11); p = 0.19. There was a significant decrease in children's self-reported short-term hunger during the intervention phase compared with the control phase, demonstrated by an increase of 8.6 units on the Freddy satiety scale (95% CI 3.4 - 13.7, p = 0.001). There were no effects of the intervention on any other outcome. Conclusion A free school breakfast programme did not have a significant effect on children's school attendance or academic achievement, but had significant positive effects on children's short-term satiety ratings.

3030675,UK/Ireland,Primary/Elementary,Behaviour and Social Wellbeing,"BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials (RCT) are required to test relationships between physical activity and cognition in children, but these must be informed by exploratory studies. This study aimed to inform future RCT by: conducting practical utility and reliability studies to identify appropriate cognitive outcome measures; piloting an RCT of a 10 week physical education (PE) intervention which involved 2 hours per week of aerobically intense PE compared to 2 hours of standard PE (control). METHODS: 64 healthy children (mean age 6.2 yrs SD 0.3; 33 boys) recruited from 6 primary schools. Outcome measures were the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Battery (CANTAB), the Attention Network Test (ANT), the Cognitive Assessment System (CAS) and the short form of the Connor's Parent Rating Scale (CPRS:S). Physical activity was measured habitually and during PE sessions using the Actigraph accelerometer. RESULTS: Test- retest intraclass correlations from CANTAB Spatial Span (r 0.51) and Spatial Working Memory Errors (0.59) and ANT Reaction Time (0.37) and ANT Accuracy (0.60) were significant, but low. Physical activity was significantly higher during intervention vs. control PE sessions (p < 0.0001). There were no significant differences between intervention and control group changes in CAS scores. Differences between intervention and control groups favoring the intervention were observed for CANTAB Spatial Span, CANTAB Spatial Working Memory Errors, and ANT Accuracy.

METHODS: We analyzed data from the High/Scope Perry Preschool Program (PPP), an early school-based intervention in which 123 children were randomized to a prekindergarten education group or a control group. In addition to exploring the effects of the program on health behavioral risk factors and health outcomes, we examined the extent to which educational attainment, income, family environment, and health insurance access mediated the relationship between randomization to PPP and behavioral and health outcomes. RESULTS: The PPP led to improvements in educational attainment, health insurance, income, and family environment Improvements in these domains, in turn, lead to improvements in an array of behavioral risk factors and health (P = .01). However, despite these reductions in behavioral risk factors, participants did not exhibit any overall improvement in physical health outcomes by the age of 40 years.

Young children from economically disadvantaged families receive less support for mathematical development both at home and in preschool. Consequently, children from different socioeconomic backgrounds enter elementary school at different levels of readiness to learn a standards-based mathematics curriculum. One approach to closing this gap is the development and implementation of effective mathematics curricula for public preschool programs enrolling economically disadvantaged children. A randomized controlled trial was conducted in 40 Head Start and state preschool classrooms, with 278 children, to determine whether a pre-kindergarten mathematics intervention was effective. Intervention teachers received training that enabled them to implement with fidelity, and a large majority of parents regularly used math activities teachers sent home. Intervention and control groups did not differ on math assessments at pretest; however, gain scores of intervention children were significantly greater than those of control children at posttest.

First and fifth graders were randomly assigned to a PA program or a no-PA control condition during one academic year. QoL was assessed by the Child Health Questionnaire at baseline and postintervention. Based on mixed linear model analyses, physical QoL in first graders and physical and psychosocial QoL in fifth graders were not affected by the intervention. In first graders, the PA intervention had a positive impact on psychosocial QoL (effect size [d], 0.32; p < .05). Subpopulation analyses revealed that this effect was caused by an effect in urban (effect size [d], 0.38; p < .05) and overweight first graders (effect size [d], 0.45; p < .05).

The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of the revised version of the DLE program for adolescents based on a cluster randomized trial (CRT) in middle schools. This study explores the design of a two-arm CRT on the effectiveness of the DLE based on the preliminary survey results. Methods: The preliminary survey was conducted in 2012 for the students of junior high schools aged 12-13 in Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan. The items used for the preliminary survey were self-rated health status, lifestyle, exercise, food intakes, BMI, etc.. Results: In total, 1182 adolescents responded the survey and analyzed the association of lifestyle characteristics on BMI and health status. Especially, indefinite complaints significantly (p < 0.05) related to intake of breakfast. Based on the observations, the study protocol including sample size (10 clusters in total; assumptions: 120 for each cluster, power=80%, significance level=5%, effect size=0.3, ICC=0.02) and education programs were determined. The hypothesis underlying the study is that adolescents in the DLE group might improve indefinite complaints from baseline after 6-month education compared to the control group. Effects of the intervention are expected to be measured after 6 months using a self-administered questionnaire. The primary endpoint is a change from baseline of a number of indefinite complaints. Energy and nutrients intakes by meal assessed using the FFQW82 as well as body mass index are the secondary endpoints.

8155647,USA/Canada,College/University,Study-Related Skills,"This dissertation addresses the differential effects of two oral corrective feedback strategies, recasts and metalinguistic prompts, on the acquisition of Chinese wh-questions and classifiers, while examining how individual differences (i.e. language analytical abilities, attitudes, and anxiety) would moderate the effects of CF. Two beginning Chinese classes were randomly assigned to the recast or metalinguistic prompts group. In a span of 5 weeks, a total of 4 treatment sessions took place. Students were tested with an oral production task and a written error correction task before, immediately after, and two weeks after the treatment. Mixed-method ANOVAs were used to analyze the differential effects of the two CF strategies on the acquisition of wh-questions and classifiers. In addition, students also completed two questionnaires, with one testing their language analytical ability, and a combined questionnaire measuring their attitudes and anxiety. Multiple regressions were used to analyze the relationship between individual differences and students??ï¿½ learning outcome. The results showed that the metalinguistic prompts group had significant gains in accuracy in all measures, regardless of testing time (posttests or delayed posttests), target forms (wh-questions or classifiers), and testing mode (oral production or written error correction tests). The recast group showed significant gains in the written tests for wh-questions and classifiers, but only achieved significant short-term gains for wh-questions in the oral test. Regarding individual differences, we found that learners??ï¿½ language analytical abilities and attitudes were important in predicting their test performance, while anxiety did not affect the learning outcome. Results were discussed within the Interactional Cognitive Framework. Form-focused instruction, along with metalinguistic prompts, which were consistent, output-pushing, and reminded students of previous learned declarative knowledge, worked better than input-providing CF (recasts) for both syntactic and lexical features. Metalinguistic prompts withheld the target L2 forms, provided metalinguistic comments, and pushed for modified output, which may have increased the likelihood for learners to close the gap between their existing knowledge and the target L2 forms, and convert declarative knowledge into procedural knowledge. The findings also suggested that CF could be delivered without raising students??ï¿½ anxiety, and helping students maintain positive attitude was important for their language development.","Effects of form-focused instruction, corrective feedback, and individual differences on the acquisition of Chinese wh-questions and classifiers","https://www.google.com/search?q=Effects+of+form-focused+instruction,+corrective+feedback,+and+individual+differences+on+the+acquisition+of+Chinese+wh-questions+and+classifiers",2016,Universal,Regular Teachers/Lecturers,Between Half and Full Term,None,None,Single,50,NA,Yes,Some Sub-Groups Reported,At Least Some Follow-Up,Yes,"Yes, Fairly Well","Yes, Theoretical Perspectives",Yes,USA/Canada College/University Study-Related Skills

To date, no information is available on the optimal frequency of physical activity on cognitive functioning in children. The current study examined the acute effects of one and two bouts of moderate-intensity physical activity on children's selective attention. Design: Randomized controlled trial (ISRCTN97975679). Methods: Thirty boys and twenty-six girls, aged 10ï¿½13 years, were randomly assigned to three conditions: (A) sitting all morning working on simulated school tasks; (B) one 20-min physical activity bout after 90min; and (C) two 20-min physical activity bouts, i.e. at the start and after 90min. Selective attention was assessed at five time points during the morning (i.e. at baseline and after 20, 110, 130 and 220min), using the ï¿½Sky Searchï¿½ subtest of the ï¿½Test of Selective Attention in Childrenï¿½. We used GEE analysis to examine differences in Sky Search scores between the three experimental conditions, adjusting for school, baseline scores, self-reported screen time and time spent in sports. Results: Children who performed two 20-min bouts of moderate-intensity physical activity had significantly better Sky Search scores compared to children who performed one physical activity bout or remained seated the whole morning (B =&minus;0.26; 95% CI=[&minus;0.52; &minus;0.00]).

8154894,Rest of Europe,Primary/Elementary,Range of Academic Outcomes,"Objective. To investigate the effect of a seven-month, school-based cluster-randomized controlled trial on academic
performance in 10-year-old children.
Methods. In total, 1129 fifth-grade children from57 elementary schools in Sogn og Fjordane County, Norway,
were cluster-randomized by school either to the intervention group or to the control group. The children in the
28 intervention schools participated in a physical activity intervention between November 2014 and June 2015
consisting of three components: 1) 90 min/week of physically active educational lessonsmainly carried out in the
school playground; 2) 5 min/day of physical activity breaks during classroomlessons; 3) 10 min/day physical activity
homework. Academic performance in numeracy, reading and English was measured using standardized
Norwegian national tests. Physical activity was measured objectively by accelerometry.
Results.We found no effect of the intervention on academic performance in primary analyses (standardized
difference 0.01–0.06, p N 0.358). Subgroup analyses, however, revealed a favorable intervention effect for those
who performed the poorest at baseline (lowest tertile) for numeracy (p=0.005 for the subgroup ∗ group interaction),
compared to controls (standardized difference 0.62, 95% CI 0.19–1.07).
Conclusions. This large, rigorously conducted cluster RCT in 10-year-old children supports the notion that
there is still inadequate evidence to conclude that increased physical activity in school enhances academic
achievement in all children. Still, combining physical activity and learning seems a viable model to stimulate
learning in those academically weakest schoolchildren.","Effects of physical activity on schoolchildren's academic performance:

Participants completed questionnaires at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Regression was undertaken to provide ORs or coefficients adjusted for clustering. Of 6244 sampled adolescents, 55.3 % participated. At 12 months there were no differences between intervention and control arms in sexual risk behaviours. Participants in the intervention arm were less likely to report IPV victimisation (35.1 vs. 40.9 %; OR 0.77, 95 % CI 0.61??ï¿½0.99; t(40) = 2.14) suggesting the intervention shaped intimate partnerships into safer ones, potentially lowering the risk for HIV.

3030992,Rest of Europe,Middle/High School,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"BACKGROUND: The Smokefree Class Competition, a school-based smoking prevention intervention, is widely disseminated in Europe. Participating classes commit themselves to be smoke-free and self-monitor their smoking status. Classes that remain smoke-free for 6 months can win prizes. Effects of the intervention on current smoking, initiation and progression of smoking were investigated. METHODS: Cluster randomised controlled trial. 84 schools (208 classes with 3490 students; mean age 12.6 years, 50.4% female) in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany, were randomly assigned to intervention or control condition. A baseline survey was conducted before the implementation of the programme, while post-test and follow-up surveys were carried out 7 (immediately after the end of the competition), 12 and 19 months after baseline. Effects of participation in the programme on current and lifetime smoking were analysed by multilevel models controlling for confounding variables. RESULTS: Intervention students smoking occasionally at baseline smoked less frequently than students taking not part in the intervention at 7 and 12 months after baseline. Persistent beneficial programme effects were also found for lifetime smoking: intervention students were less likely to progress from experimental to established use. CONCLUSION: Data suggest that Smokefree Class Competition reduces the probability of progressing from occasional and experimental stages of smoking to more established forms of use.

Method: Over 9 mo, students in 2 second-grade classrooms in a southeastern rural elementary school used stability balls as chairs while students in 2 control classrooms used chairs as usual. We collected measures of on-task behavior, standardized measures of literacy and mathematics achievement, and discipline referrals. Results: We found similar levels of on-task behavior and achievement in treatment and control classrooms and a downward trend in disruptive behaviors in treatment classrooms. Conclusion: This study did not find use of stability balls for entire general education classrooms to be a practical use of resources for schools.

Since 2005 all first-year medical students of the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre participate in a first aid and BLS-course. Senior medical students, who have attended an in-service training but are not officially certified, are the course instructors. Recently, the Dutch Resuscitation Council (DRC) provides and certifies a 2-days train the trainer course for BLS. The aim of this study was to evaluate the additional value of such course on the quality of feedback and hands-on exercises. Materials and methods: Ten senior student certified DRCinstructors (in-service training + train the trainer) and 14 student control instructors (in-service training only), and 350 first year medical students participated in this study. Students were randomized to receive training from either a control instructor (n = 202) or DRC-instructor (n = 148). They were blinded for the type of instructor. Every student filled in a questionnaire after the first, fourth and eighth lesson scoring the quality of the training and the feedback they received. Secondary endpoint was the result of the final BLS examination by type of instructor. Results: Cronbach's alpha of the questionnaire was 0.915. The appreciation of feedback increased from lesson one to lesson eight. DRC-instructors scored significantly higher on the practical training of BLS (p = 0.008) whereas control instructors performed significantly better on parts of the theoretical BLS training (p = 0.001). The type of instructor had no effect on the result of the final exam of the first year students (p = 0.949). Discussion: The additional value of a train the trainer course on top of in-service training for senior medical students is not evident from the trainee perspective.

Faced with this observation, the governments of Canada and New Brunswick wish for a greater involvement of schools in prevention and detection efforts. To do this, schools would notably play a role in the development of protective factors that foster resilience in youth. The Search Institute's developmental assets framework provides a target for interventions by suggesting a list of internal and external resources that youth should be able to draw on to face adversity. Dialectic behavioural therapy (DBT) constitutes one form of intervention that aims at developing individuals' capabilities to deal with adversity. This paper presents results from a randomized trial that examined the effect of a DBT-based intervention on the progression of developmental assets. The intervention consisted in six weekly sessions of 70 minutes during which social and emotional competency training was offered to groups of 25 to 30 pupils. There were 146 study participants, grade 9 and 10, from two francophone schools in New Brunswick. Pupils were randomly assigned to one of three groups (experimental, placebo and control) and completed the French version of the Developmental Assets Profile before the intervention as well as one month after Results suggest a positive effect of the intervention on four types of assets (support, empowerment, boundaries and expectations, and commitment to learning), especially for pupils with the lowest developmental asset scores at baseline.

The media campaign was supported with school and community events that reinforced campaign messages. Tests of recognition and recall indicated widespread exposure to the media intervention. Multiple group latent growth models indicated that relative to control students, intervention students reported significant differences in rates of growth for intent for violence, physical assault against people, verbal victimization, and perceived safety at school. No differences were found for verbal assault, physical assault against objects, physical victimization, or self-efficacy for avoiding violence. When examined by sex, it was determined that results for physical assault against people were obtained only among female students, and changes in verbal victimization and perceived school safety were observed only among male students.

Methods: Teaching assistants (TAs) were trained to deliver a reading and language intervention to children in individual daily 40-min sessions. We used a waiting list control design, in which half the sample received the intervention immediately, whereas the remaining children received the treatment after a 20-week delay. Fifty-seven children with Down syndrome in mainstream primary schools in two UK locations (Yorkshire and Hampshire) were randomly allocated to intervention (40 weeks of intervention) and waiting control (20 weeks of intervention) groups. Assessments were conducted at three time points: pre-intervention, after 20 weeks of intervention, and after 40 weeks of intervention. Results: After 20 weeks of intervention, the intervention group showed significantly greater progress than the waiting control group on measures of single word reading, letter-sound knowledge, phoneme blending and taught expressive vocabulary. Effects did not transfer to other skills (nonword reading, spelling, standardised expressive and receptive vocabulary, expressive information and grammar). After 40 weeks of intervention, the intervention group remained numerically ahead of the control group on most key outcome measures; but these differences were not significant. Children who were younger, attended more intervention sessions, and had better initial receptive language skills made greater progress during the course of the intervention.

DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Urban public schools. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 662 African American students in grades 6 and 7. INTERVENTIONS: An 8-hour abstinence-only intervention targeted reduced sexual intercourse; an 8-hour safer sex-only intervention targeted increased condom use; 8-hour and 12-hour comprehensive interventions targeted sexual intercourse and condom use; and an 8-hour health-promotion control intervention targeted health issues unrelated to sexual behavior. Participants also were randomized to receive or not receive an intervention maintenance program to extend intervention efficacy. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was self-report of ever having sexual intercourse by the 24-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes were other sexual behaviors. RESULTS: The participants' mean age was 12.2 years; 53.5% were girls; and 84.4% were still enrolled at 24 months. Abstinence-only intervention reduced sexual initiation (risk ratio [RR], 0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48-0.96). The model-estimated probability of ever having sexual intercourse by the 24-month follow-up was 33.5% in the abstinence-only intervention and 48.5% in the control group. Fewer abstinence-only intervention participants (20.6%) than control participants (29.0%) reported having coitus in the previous 3 months during the follow-up period (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.90-0.99).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of an educational program targeted to high school students on opinions concerning organ donation. METHODS: Sixteen public high schools in Torino, Italy, were randomized (2001 to 2002) as interventions (n = 8) or controls (n = 8). Intervention was composed of first questionnaire, first lesson (one to two classes; 2 hours, by a trained nephrology fellow); second lesson (all classes together; coordinated by a nephrologist, with patients and trainees); second questionnaire. Control included questionnaires. Statistical analysis compared the opinions in the questionnaires after stratification for age, sex, and type of school. RESULTS: Fourteen schools completed the program (seven interventions: 937 first and 808 second questionnaires; controls: 739 and 659). Television (82.5%) and newspapers (43.2%) were the main sources of information; knowledge on renal transplantation (grafts feasible per patient, average duration) was low; only 12.2% of the students gave correct answers. The opinions on living donation were highly positive (76.8%) with no difference in control, intervention schools, first and second questionnaires, according to sex, age, or type of school. The opinions on cadaveric transplantation were affected by the educational intervention with a drop in negative answers (from 33.7% to 16%), with an increase in positive (from 31.5% to 42.9%) and in uncertain ones (from 34.8% to 41.1%) among the intervention schools; 98% of the students appreciated the program. CONCLUSION: The positive effect on student opinions suggests the need to develop educational approaches as a part of our routine clinical work.","Efficacy of an educational program on dialysis, renal transplantation, and organ donation on the opinions of high school students: a randomized controlled trial","https://www.google.com/search?q=Efficacy+of+an+educational+program+on+dialysis,+renal+transplantation,+and+organ+donation+on+the+opinions+of+high+school+students:+a+randomized+controlled+trial",2004,Universal,External Educators,Up to Half a Term,None,None,Clustered,1676,14,yes,Whole Sample Only,Immediate Post-Test Only,No,No,"Yes, Descriptive Theory of Change",No,Rest of Europe Middle/High School Other School Subjects

OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy of an educational programme on opinions on organ transplantation and kidney donation. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial: eight intervention and eight control schools were randomly selected from the 33 public schools that agreed to participate. Targets: students in the last 2 years of secondary school (17-18 years); seven schools per group completed the study. EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMME: Intervention: first questionnaire (anonymous); 2 h lesson in each class; 2 h general session with patients and experts; second questionnaire. CONTROL: questionnaires. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Differences between questionnaires (comparative analysis); interest; satisfaction with the programme; (cross-sectional analysis). RESULTS: 1776 first, 1467 second questionnaires were retrieved. Living kidney donation: at baseline 78.8% of students would donate a kidney to a relative/friend in need. The answers were unaffected by type of school but depended on sex (females more prone to donate, P<0.001); the answers did not change after the lessons. Cadaveric kidney donation: baseline opinions were mixed (intervention schools: 31.5% yes, 33.7% no, 34.8% uncertain), depending on type of school (classical-scientific high schools more positive than technical institutes, P<0.001), sex (males more prone to donate, P<0.001).

3031014,USA/Canada,College/University,Professional Training,"Purpose: To examine whether an Internet-based learning module and small-group debriefing can improve medical traineesï¿½ attitudes and communication skills toward patients with substance use disorders (SUDs). Method: In 2011ï¿½2012, 129 internal and family medicine residents and 370 medical students at two medical schools participated in a cluster randomized controlled trial, which assessed the effect of adding a two-part intervention to the SUDs curricula. The intervention included a self-directed, media-rich Internet-based learning module and a small-group, faculty-led debriefing. Primary study outcomes were changes in self-assessed attitudes in the intervention group (I-group) compared with those in the control group (C-group) (i.e., a difference of differences). For residents, the authors used real-time, Web-based interviews of standardized patients to assess changes in communication skills. Statistical analyses, conducted separately for residents and students, included hierarchical linear modeling, adjusted for site, participant type, cluster, and individual scores at baseline. Results: The authors found no significant differences between the I- and C-groups in attitudes for residents or students at baseline. Compared with those in the C-group, residents, but not students, in the I-group had more positive attitudes toward treatment efficacy and self-efficacy at follow-up (P < .006). Likewise, compared with residents in the C-group, residents in the I-group received higher scores on screening and counseling skills during the standardized patient interview at follow-up (P = .0009). Conclusions: This intervention produced improved attitudes and communication skills toward patients with SUDs among residents. Enhanced attitudes and skills may result in improved care for these patients.

In particular, academic worry is a common theme in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) samples as well as non-clinical student samples. Given the high cost of anxiety disorders to society, research is needed to examine the efficacy of self-administered treatments designed to reduce pathological worry. The primary goal of this study was to investigate the benefits of three self-administered interventions for reducing academic worry. College students (N = 113) experiencing clinically significant academic worry were randomized to either: (a) worry exposure (WE); (b) expressive writing (EW); (c) relaxation consisting of pulsed audio-photic stimulation (APS); or (d) waitlist control (WLC). Participants were instructed to practice their interventions three times per week for one month and completed home practice logs online to track treatment adherence. Academic worry, general anxiety, and perceived stress were assessed at baseline and post-treatment. Academic worry and general anxiety were also assessed at a three-month follow-up.

Methods: A sample (N = 77) of children drawn from 14 schools representing those with the weakest reading skills were randomly allocated to one of two groups. A 20-week intervention group received the intervention for two consecutive 10-week periods, while a 10-week intervention group only received the intervention for the second 10 weeks of the study. The programme was delivered in daily 20-minute sessions that alternated between small group (N = 3) and individual teaching. The programme combined phoneme awareness training, word and text reading, and phonological linkage exercises. Results: The children receiving the intervention during the first 10-week period made significantly more progress on measures of letter knowledge, single word reading, and phoneme awareness than children not receiving the intervention. However, the children who only received the intervention during the second 10-week period made rapid progress and appeared to catch up with the children who had been given the more prolonged intervention. Failure to respond to the intervention was predicted by poor initial literacy skills and being in receipt of free school meals. Conclusion: A reading intervention programme delivered on a daily basis by trained teaching assistants is an effective intervention for children who show reading delays at the end of their first year in school.

To evaluate the therapy's effectiveness for school-age students, a randomized controlled trial (RCT, N = 157) was conducted. Based on a pre-post-test design, the programme's impacts were compared with a control group (CG) that did not receive the strategy training. Potential long-term impacts were analysed with a follow-up test (four months after the intervention was completed). Therapeutic success is interpreted by an improved performance in standardized tests compared to the CG. The experimental group (EG) made significant to highly significant progress on both lexical and syntactical levels. The improvements of the EG are statistically significantly higher compared to the control group's performance (exception: Subtest I, P-ITPA). Consequently, the trial proves the advantages of this strategy therapy compared to the CG, finding that the Lexicon Pirate is an effective approach for treating lexical disorders of school-age students.

Students at schools assigned to the RC condition did not outperform students at schools assigned to the control condition in math or reading achievement. Use of RC practices mediated the relation between treatment assignment and improved math and reading achievement. Effect sizes (ES) were calculated as standardized coefficients. ES relations between use of RC practices and achievement were 0.26 for math and 0.30 for reading. The RC practices and math achievement relation was greater for students with low initial math achievement (ES = 0.89).

should be designed to optimize their effectiveness. This study assessed the impact two
learning instructional design methods (mental practice and modeling), either on their own
or in combination, for teaching complex cognitive medical content when incorporated into
enhanced podcasts. Sixty-three medical students were randomised to one of four versions
of an airway management enhanced podcast: (1) control: narrated presentation; (2) modeling:
narration with video demonstration of skills; (3) mental practice: narrated presentation
with guided mental practice; (4) combined: modeling and mental practice. One week
later, students managed a manikin-based simulated airway crisis. Knowledge acquisition
was assessed by baseline and retention multiple-choice quizzes. Two blinded raters
assessed all videos obtained from simulated crises to measure the students’ skills using a
key-elements scale, critical error checklist, and the Ottawa global rating scale (GRS).
Baseline knowledge was not different between all four groups (p = 0.65). One week later, knowledge retention was significantly higher for (1) both the mental practice and modeling
group than the control group (p = 0.01; p = 0.01, respectively) and (2) the combined
mental practice and modeling group compared to all other groups (all ps = 0.01).
Regarding skills acquisition, the control group significantly under-performed in comparison
to all other groups on the key-events scale (all ps B 0.05), the critical error checklist
(all ps B 0.05), and the Ottawa GRS (all ps B 0.05). The combination of mental practice
and modeling led to greater improvement on the key events checklist (p = 0.01) compared
to either strategy alone. However, the combination of the two strategies did not result in
any further learning gains on the two other measures of clinical performance (all
ps[0.05). The effectiveness of enhanced podcasts for knowledge retention and clinical
skill acquisition is increased with either mental practice or modeling. The combination of
mental practice and modeling had synergistic effects on knowledge retention, but conveyed
less clear advantages in its application through clinical skills.","E-learning optimization: the relative and combined

heart disease. Previous studies have reported deficiencies
in ECG interpretation skills that have been responsible for
misdiagnosis. However, the optimal way to acquire ECG
interpretation skills is still under discussion. Thus, our
objective was to compare the effectiveness of e-learning
and lecture-based courses for learning ECG interpretation
skills in a large randomized study.
Participants and methods We conducted a prospective,
randomized, controlled, noninferiority study. Participants
were recruited from among fifth-year medical students and
were assigned to the e-learning group or the lecture-based
group using a computer-generated random allocation
sequence. The e-learning and lecture-based groups were
compared on a score of effectiveness, comparing the 95%
unilateral confidence interval (95% UCI) of the score of
effectiveness with the mean effectiveness in the lecturebased
group, adjusted for a noninferiority margin.
Results Ninety-eight students were enrolled. As compared
with the lecture-based course, e-learning was noninferior
with regard to the postcourse test score (15.1; 95% UCI
14.2; +∞), which can be compared with 12.5 [the mean
effectiveness in the lecture-based group (15.0) minus
the noninferiority margin (2.5)]. Furthermore, there
was a significant increase in the test score points in both
the e-learning and lecture-based groups during the study
period (both P<0.0001).
Conclusion Our randomized study showed that the
e-learning course is an effective tool for the acquisition
of ECG interpretation skills by medical students. These
preliminary results should be confirmed with further
multicenter studies before the implementation of e-learning
courses for learning ECG interpretation skills during
medical school.","e-Learning versus lecture-based courses in ECG

However, the superior effectiveness of the 4-stage approach was never proved. Objectives: To evaluate whether skill training with the 4-stage approach results in shorter performance time needed for a successful percutaneous needle-puncture cricothyroidotomy, and consequently in a reduced number of attempts needed to perform the skill in <60 s compared to traditional teaching. Trial design: Randomized controlled single-blinded parallel group study at the University Hospital Bern. Methods: With IRB approval and informed consent 128 undergraduate medical students were randomized in four groups: traditional teaching, no stage 2, no stage 3, and 4-stage approach for the training of cricothyroidotomy. Everyone watched a video of the cricothyroidotomy as stage 1 followed by skill training in the respective teaching group. Participants had to perform the cricothyroidotomy 10 times on skin-covered pig larynxes. Performance time was measured from skin palpation to trachea ventilation. Study participants filled out a self-rating on competency during the training. Results: Performance time for each attempt was comparable in all groups and improved similarly to reach a performance time of <60 s. Self-rating revealed that all groups felt equally competent throughout.

Scores were highest in Group 4 (35.9 + 8.7), followed by Groups 3 (35.7 + 6.5), 2 (33.5 + 9.4), and 1 (28.0 + 9.6; p = .007). Students in Groups 4 (60.7%) and 3 (57.7%) achieved adequate counseling skills more frequently than those in Groups 2 (34.8%) and 1 (30%; p = .043). There was no difference in the scores reflecting theoretical knowledge (p = .439). Self-assessment of cessation skills and students' satisfaction with training was significantly better in Groups 3 and 4 as compared with 1 and 2 (p < .001 and p = .006, respectively). Conclusions: Role playing and interaction with real patients are equally efficient and both more powerful learning tools than web-based learning with or without a lecture. The Author 2011.

3030915,USA/Canada,Primary/Elementary,Behaviour and Social Wellbeing,"The authors hypothesized that a social and emotional learning (SEL) program involving mindfulness and caring for others, designed for elementary school students, would enhance cognitive control, reduce stress, promote well-being and prosociality, and produce positive school outcomes. To test this hypothesis, 4 classes of combined 4th and 5th graders (N = 99) were randomly assigned to receive the SEL with mindfulness program versus a regular social responsibility program. Measures assessed executive functions (EFs), stress physiology via salivary cortisol, well-being (self-reports), prosociality and peer acceptance (peer reports), and math grades. Relative to children in the social responsibility program, children who received the SEL program with mindfulness (a) improved more in their cognitive control and stress physiology; (b) reported greater empathy, perspective-taking, emotional control, optimism, school self-concept, and mindfulness, (c) showed greater decreases in self-reported symptoms of depression and peer-rated aggression, (d) were rated by peers as more prosocial, and (e) increased in peer acceptance (or sociometric popularity).

3030909,Central/South America,Primary/Elementary,Behaviour and Social Wellbeing,"Interest in social-emotional and character development (SECD) programming has intensified in recent years. SECD-related programs often seek to enhance a variety of health-related outcomes by addressing multiple influences and embracing a comprehensive approach that includes youth, school personnel, families, and communities. Alongside a comprehensive approach arises the need for a comprehensive, integrative theory. To address this need, the first manuscript serves as (1) an empirical review of the SECD-related literature and (2) a theoretical orientation whereby the Theory of Triadic Influence provides a roadmap to guide the design and evaluation of SECD-related programs. The second and third manuscripts examine one example of a SECD program, Positive Action (PA), utilizing data from the PA Hawai'i trial conducted from 2002ï¿½03 through 2005ï¿½06. The trial was a matched-pair, cluster-randomized, controlled trial that included 20 racially/ethnically diverse schools. Specifically, the second manuscript builds upon previous research and examines a mechanism whereby improvements in academic-related behaviors mediated the PA program effects on negative behaviors. Structural equation models, with a latent academic behavior mediator, indicated that students attending program schools reported significantly better academic behavior. Program effects on student-reported substance use, violence, and sexual activity were mediated by greater academic behavior. Teacher reports corroborated these results. The third manuscript explores the impact of the PA program on school-level indicators of school quality, thereby examining the ability of a SECD program to create contextual, whole-school change. Teacher, parent, and student archival school-level data were analyzed to examine indicators of school quality such as student safety and well-being, involvement, and satisfaction, as well as overall school quality. Program schools demonstrated a significant improvement in individual indicators and overall school quality compared to control schools. Therefore, consistent with theory, a SECD program demonstrated the ability to enhance school quality and facilitate whole-school change.

3031580,USA/Canada,Middle/High School,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"BACKGROUND: Our objective was to evaluate the effects of environmental, policy, and social marketing interventions on physical activity and fat intake of middle school students on campus. DESIGN: Twenty-four middle schools were randomly assigned to intervention or control conditions. Baseline measures were collected in spring 1997, and interventions were conducted during the 1997-1998 and 1998-1999 school years SETTING/PARTICIPATION: The schools had mean enrollments of 1109, with 44.5% nonwhite students. Over 2 years, physical activity interventions were designed to increase physical activity in physical education classes and throughout the school day. Nutrition interventions were designed to provide and market low-fat foods at all school food sources, including cafeteria breakfasts and lunches, a la carte sources, school stores, and bag lunches. School staff and students were engaged in policy change efforts, but there was no classroom health education. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Primary outcomes were measured by direct observation and existing records. RESULTS: Randomized regression models (N =24 schools) revealed a significant intervention effect for physical activity for the total group (p <0.009) and boys (p <0.001), but not girls (p <0.40). The intervention was not effective for total fat (p <0.91) or saturated fat (p <0.79). Survey data indicated that the interventions reduced reported body mass index for boys (p <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Environmental and policy interventions were effective in increasing physical activity at school among boys but not girls. The interventions were not effective in reducing fat intake at school.

The use of gynecological teaching associates to teach pelvic exam skills to medical students is an example of an education intervention that deserves thorough evaluation. PURPOSE: The objective was to evaluate effects of two pelvic examination training methods on OB/GYN clerkship students with respect to costs, students' performance, and perception. METHOD: During the academic year 2007-08, 106 medical students were randomized to receive either pelvic examination training by a gynecological teaching associate (GTA) alone or a standardized patient (SP) accompanied by an obstetrics and gynecology faculty member. Students participated in an objective structured clinical exam (OSCE) and completed questionnaires regarding the educational intervention at the end of the clerkship. RESULTS: The two training methods produced comparable OSCE scores, and students in both groups felt more confident after training and found the training sessions to be valuable. There was a significant cost-savings associated with using GTAs for pelvic exam training.

To date, the majority of PECS studies have been largely based on single cases or small groups. The effectiveness of implementing PECS in school has received little attention. Seventeen classes, from 15 schools, with a total of 84 children participated in the study. Using a group-randomised, control trial design (RCT), class groups were assigned into one of three treatment groups: Immediate, Delayed or No treatment. Class staff from the Immediate and Delayed treatment groups attended a PECS workshop and received 6 in-class consultation visits. Children were observed in class snack sessions and assessed on standardised tests of social communication, language and nonverbal ability at baseline and twice further over 20 months. Following PECS training, rates of children's spontaneous communication and use of pictures of symbols during snack time had significantly increased. Specifically higher rates of spontaneous use of pictures of symbols and spontaneous use of speech or vocalisation to make requests for objects of help were seen. There was no effect of treatment on overall speech or vocalisation production and the effects of treatment did not appear to generalise to a formal assessment of social communication skills.

To determine if there was a difference in achievement between students involved in 16 weeks of predifferentiated, enriched mathematics curricula and students using their district&apos;s curricula, we conducted a multisite cluster-randomized control trial with 43 schools in 12 states. A series of three-level models, using pre- and postachievement test data, failed to show a main effect for treatment, but the results suggested a treatment by achievement-level interaction that was moderated by the achievement level of the school. As a result, the highest achieving students in the lower achieving schools seemed to receive the greatest benefit from the treatment curricula. An analysis of researcher-developed unit tests revealed that treatment students successfully learned and applied the curricula&apos;s challenging mathematics. Thus, using the predifferentiated and enriched mathematics curricula with heterogeneous ability students appeared to 'do no harm'-students who completed the treatment curricula did as well as their control counterparts, on average.

Altogether 141 children participated: 73 in the intervention group and 68 in the control group, with follow up evaluations available on 117 (83%). The primary outcome was safe cycling behavior (straight line riding, coming to a complete stop, and shoulder checking before a left turn). A self report questionnaire collected data on knowledge and attitudes. Baseline assessments were made in June, with follow up evaluations in September, 1995. RESULTS: The prevalence of safe cycling behaviors at follow up in the intervention and control groups respectively, were: straight line riding (90% v 88%; p = 0.782), coming to a complete stop (90% v 76%; p = 0.225), and shoulder checking (0% v 2%; p = 1.000).

However, resources and evidence for adequate interventions are scarce for children in low- and middle-income countries. This study evaluated a school-based psychosocial intervention in conflict-affected, rural Nepal. Methods: A cluster randomized controlled trial was used to evaluate changes on a range of indicators, including psychiatric symptoms (depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder), psychological difficulties, resilience indicators (hope, prosocial behavior) and function impairment. Children (n = 325) (mean age = 12.7, SD = 1.04, range 11-14 years) with elevated psychosocial distress were allocated to a treatment or waitlist group. Results: Comparisons of crude change scores showed significant between-group differences on several outcome indicators, with moderate effect sizes (Cohen d = 0.41 to 0.58). After correcting for nested variance within schools, no evidence for treatment effects was found on any outcome variable. Additional analyses showed gender effects for treatment on prosocial behavior (mean change difference: 2.70; 95% CI, 0.97 to 4.44), psychological difficulties (-2.19; 95% CI, -3.82 to -0.56), and aggression (-4.42; 95% CI, -6.16 to -2.67).

Recent research suggests that group cognitive-behavioral interventions can reduce and prevent symptoms of depression in youth. Few studies have tested the effectiveness of such interventions when delivered by school teachers and counselors (as opposed to research team staff). We evaluated the effectiveness of the Penn Resiliency Program for adolescents (PRP-A), a school-based group intervention that targets cognitive behavioral risk factors for depression. We randomly assigned 408 middle school students (ages 10-15) to one of three conditions: PRP-A, PRP-AP (in which adolescents participated in PRP-A and parents were invited to attend a parent intervention component), or a school-as-usual control. Adolescents completed measures of depression and anxiety symptoms, cognitive style, and coping at baseline, immediately after the intervention, and at 6-month follow-up. PRP-A reduced depression symptoms relative to the school as usual control. Baseline levels of hopelessness moderated intervention effects. Among participants with average and high levels of hopelessness, PRP (A and AP) significantly improved depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, hopelessness, and active coping relative to control. Among participants with low baseline hopelessness, we found no intervention effects. PRP-AP was not more effective than PRP-A alone. We found no intervention effects on clinical levels of depression or anxiety.

The perceptions of the students who participated in the experimental model were evaluated and compared with those who participated in a traditional model of practical activity. An 18-point questionnaire evaluated students' perceptions of aspects of the course itself (such as its duration and organization), personal response characteristics (such as entertainment, interest and effort required) and the current and future utility of the activities which had been carried out. A randomized, double-controlled and double-blind study compared experimental (n = 110) and control groups (n = 63). Students pertaining to the experimental group reported deeper satisfaction and greater participation in the activity. They evaluated more positively the utility of the educational activity for their future profession and more frequently considered that they had acquired useful skills or attitudes. Members of the experimental group recognized that they had invested more time and effort than those of the control group. No differences related to organization, support received and attitudes of teachers were observed between groups. In conclusion, a transitional intervention from traditional models towards PBL-based medical education was favourably evaluated by the participants.

The results showed no main effect of the program on depressive symptoms at one-year follow-up. A moderation effect was found for parental psychopathology; adolescents who had parents with psychopathology and received the OVK program had less depressive symptoms compared to adolescents with parents with psychopathology in the control condition. No moderating effects on depressive symptoms were found for gender, ethnical background, and level of baseline depressive symptoms. An iatrogenic effect of the intervention was found on the secondary outcome of clinical depressive symptoms. Based on the low level of reported depressive symptoms at baseline, it seems that our sample might not meet the characteristics of a high-risk selective group for depressive symptoms. Therefore, no firm conclusions can be drawn about the selective potential of the OVK depression prevention program.

3031796,USA/Canada,College/University,Behaviour and Social Wellbeing,"National surveys indicate that approximately 15.9 percent of full-time students attending 4-year universities in the U.S. for the first time come from families where neither of their parents attended college (Pryor et al. 2006). These 'first-generation college students' have been deemed an at-risk group based on evidence that they experience extensive stressors, both those related to adjusting to being a college student generally as well as unique disadvantages and heightened stressors related to factors associated with their first-generation status (Choy, 2001; Pryor et al., 2006; Thayer, 2000). Although previous studies have examined the outcomes of stress management programs for college students, these studies have methodological limitations and no known study has examined the areas of impact of such an intervention for first-generation college students specifically. Accordingly, the present project examined important adjustment outcomes of a stress management program designed to help first-generation freshman effectively cope with the demands of college life. Using a RCT design, 56 incoming first-generation college students were randomly assigned to either a control or an intervention group. Participants in the intervention group participated in a weekly 7-session mind/body stress management and support group. All participants completed a pre- and post-intervention assessment that included measures of distress/impaired functioning, social support, health promoting behaviors, adaptive coping, and academic performance. Using MANCOVA, controlling for pre-intervention differences between groups, there was a significant difference at post-intervention between the intervention and control group on the combined dependent variables. Specifically, the intervention group reported significantly lower distress and impaired functioning, significantly greater social support, marginally greater health promoting behaviors, and no significant difference in perceived stress and adaptive coping. Independent samples t-tests revealed no difference between intervention participants and controls in GPA at either post-intervention or 16 week follow-up. Participant satisfaction with the intervention was high.

A cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted involving 50 post-primary schools from across Northern Ireland. However, dropout and exclusion criteria utilized for the current study resulted in an effective sample size of 42 schools. The intervention was delivered in two 35-min classroom sessions targeting those beliefs identified by the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) as significant in predicting motivation to breastfeed. Questionnaires incorporating the key components of the TPB were administered to all intervention and control schools at baseline, 1 and 6 months post-intervention. Multi-level modelling was used to analyse the data. Findings suggest that the intervention was effective in that it increased females' intentions to breastfeed, expanded their knowledge and led to more favourable attitudes and perceptions of subjective norms.

Several international organizations indicate a need to assess the stigma that exists and to develop and evaluate interventions to dispel myths about epilepsy. Methods: A stratified cluster randomized controlled trial evaluated whether an epilepsy education program (intervention) increases knowledge of and positive attitudes about epilepsy in Grade 5 students (ages 9-11). The study also investigated characteristics of the individuals (gender, language spoken at home, familiarity with epilepsy) and schools (Catholic vs public, size of school, and school level socioeconomic status) that affect epilepsy knowledge and attitudes. We assessed epilepsy knowledge and attitudes at baseline and 1 month following the program using a 33-item questionnaire. Results: In total, 24 schools (783 individuals) were cluster randomized. Those in the intervention group had an average 11.8-point increase (95% confidence interval (CI)=11.4-12.5) in knowledge 1 month following the program, compared with the control group increase of 2.2 points (95% CI = 1.8-2.6) out of a total of 57 points. For attitudes, the intervention group had a mean increase of 8.15 points (95% CI=4.70-11.60), compared with the control group increase of 1.64 points (95% CI=-0.84-4.42) out of a total of 50 points. The intervention was responsible for 63% of the variation in postprogram epilepsy knowledge and 28% of the variation in postprogram attitudes about epilepsy.

The purpose of the present paper was to evaluate its short term effects. Methodology/Principal Findings: A total of 3147 pupils from Belgium, Germany, Greece, Hungary and Norway participated in a school-randomized controlled trial. The intervention included 1-2 school lessons per week for a period of six weeks, along with assignments for the children and their parents. Screen time and breaking up sitting time were registered by self-report and total sedentary time and breaking up sitting time by accelerometry. The effect of the intervention on these behaviors was evaluated by multilevel regression analyses. All analyses were adjusted for baseline values and gender. Significance level was p<.01. No significant intervention effects were observed, neither for self-reported TV/DVD or computer/game console time, nor for accelerometer-assessed total sedentary time and number of breaks in sitting time. The intervention group, however, reported more positive attitudes towards (beta = 0.25 (95% CI 0.11, 0.38)) and preferences/liking for (beta = 0.20 (95% CI 0.08, 0.32)) breaking up sitting time than the control group. Conclusions/Significance: No significant intervention effect on self-reported screen time or accelerometer-assessed sedentary time or breaks in sitting time was observed, but positive effects on beliefs regarding breaking up sitting time were found in favor of the intervention group.

The program evaluation examined the classroom adoption approaches used by participating teachers and the subsequent impact of the 'Language, Literacy, & Vocabulary!' (LLV) program on students' content area literacy development. The LLV program provides curriculum resources for vocabulary and comprehension development through study of academic content. Materials are designed for multi-need instruction of English language learners, at-risk readers, and special need learners. Methodology: The study was conducted in urban Illinois public schools with 259 students in 4 schools, 90 students in the treatment groups and 169 students in the control groups. Classes of students were assigned to treatment or control groups. Pre- and post-test data from students provides insight into how effectively the 'Language, Literacy, & Vocabulary!' program improves students' content area literacy. Teachers in the treatment classrooms taught 3 to 6 units and used a wide variety of LLV instructional tools and assessments with students on a daily basis. Weekly units were taught in a continuous duration. Results: A thorough analysis of the data collected indicates that the students in treatment groups made statistically significant gains in their content area literacy development compared with student who did not use the 'Language, Literacy, & Vocabulary!' curriculum. In each curriculum group, the mean improvement from pretest to posttest was substantially higher for the students in the treatment groups.

This is the first study to test the effects of group versus individual delivery of evidence-based intervention for aggressive children. Method: Three hundred sixty fourth-grade children were randomly assigned by school to group coping power (GCP) or individual coping power (ICP). Longitudinal assessments of teacher and parent reports of behavior (Behavior Assessment System for Children [BASC]; Peer Affiliation and Social Acceptance [PASA]) were collected from baseline through a 1-year follow-up. Results: Growth curve analyses revealed that children in both conditions reduced teacher- and parent-reported externalizing behavior problems and internalizing behavior problems by the end of the 1-year follow-up. However, the degree of improvement in teacher-reported outcomes was significantly greater for children receiving an individual version of the program. In addition, childrenï¿½s baseline level of inhibitory control moderated intervention effects, showing children with low initial levels of inhibitory control to respond poorly in teacher-rated outcomes to group interventions compared to those delivered individually. Conclusions: This study suggests overall benefits to children for either group or individual delivery of the Coping Power program under high-fidelity conditions; however, for children with low levels of initial self-regulation, individualized interventions will likely yield the most significant reduction in externalizing behavior in the school setting in preadolescence.

A total of 16 classrooms (N = 258) were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: Text Structure (TS) Program, Content-Only (CO) Program, or No Treatment (Control) group. The TS Program consisted of five units, with each unit focusing on one text structure (sequence, compare-contrast, cause-effect, description, and problem-solution) and on one historical community (Native Americans, Colonists, Pioneers, Immigrants, modern urban residents). Students in TS learned strategies for reading and closely analyzing well-structured text: clue words, strategy questions, and graphic organizers. Other activities included trade book reading and summary writing. Students in the CO Program studied the same five historical communities, read the same trade books, closely read the same well-structured texts, and also wrote summaries, but did not explicitly learn about the text structure or its related strategies. Results from two-level hierarchical linear modeling analyses indicated that students in TS significantly outperformed the other two groups in Comprehension Written Summary measures (main idea, structure statements) in both the end-of-unit tests given immediately after each unit and in the posttest given at the very end of the year-long program. Students in TS also significantly outperformed the other two groups in some Comprehension Transfer measures (sentence completion, main idea questions and paragraph structure identification questions). Students in TS also showed some transfer to comprehending authentic text.

SWPBIS aims to alter school environments by creating improved systems and procedures that promote positive change in student behavior by targeting staff behaviors. This study uses data from a 5-year longitudinal randomized controlled effectiveness trial of SWPBIS conducted in 37 elementary schools to examine the impact of training in SWPBIS on implementation fidelity as well as student suspensions, office discipline referrals, and academic achievement. School-level longitudinal analyses indicated that the schools trained in SWPBIS implemented the model with high fidelity and experienced significant reductions in student suspensions and office discipline referrals.

A total of 103 English teachers were stratified by school and grade and randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. Each year, Pathway teachers participated in 46 hours of training and learned how to apply a cognitive strategies approach to literacy instruction in order to help students understand, interpret, and write analytical essays about themes in literature. Through a textual analysis of 300 randomly sampled pre- and 300 post-intervention essays collected from 1,640 mainstreamed secondary ELs (820 experimental and 820 control), this study examined the ways in which the intervention impacted the writing outcomes of secondary ELs. A univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the students&apos; literary analysis and the use of commentary in their essays with the number of years in the treatment condition as the independent variable revealed significant effects of the intervention on the afore-mentioned posttest measures, with students who received 2 years of the intervention outperforming those who received only 1 year of the intervention.","Examining the Text-Based, On-Demand, Analytical Writing of Mainstreamed Latino English Learners in a Randomized Field Trial of the Pathway Project Intervention","https://www.google.com/search?q=Examining+the+Text-Based,+On-Demand,+Analytical+Writing+of+Mainstreamed+Latino+English+Learners+in+a+Randomized+Field+Trial+of+the+Pathway+Project+Intervention",2013,Targeted,Regular Teachers/Lecturers,Full Academic Year or Longer,None,None,Clustered,300,6,Yes,Whole Sample Only,Immediate Post-Test Only,Yes,No,No,No,USA/Canada Middle/High School Literacy/English
3031073,USA/Canada,Primary/Elementary,Behaviour and Social Wellbeing,"School-Wide Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (SWPBIS; Sugai & Horner, 2006) is currently implemented in over 20,000 schools across the country with the goal of preventing disruptive behavior problems and enhancing the school climate. While previous studies have indicated significant main effects of SWPBIS on student outcomes, the program impacts likely vary as a function of childrenï¿½s socialï¿½emotional characteristics. This study examined variation in the effects of SWPBIS based on childrenï¿½s baseline pattern of behavior problems and socialï¿½emotional skills using data from a randomized controlled effectiveness trial. Data come from 12,344 elementary school children (52.9% male; 45.1% African American and 46.1% White; 49% received free or reduced-price meals; and 12.9% received special education services). The group randomized controlled effectiveness trial was implemented in 37 elementary schools. Latent profile analyses (LPA) were conducted on teachersï¿½ baseline ratings of childrenï¿½s behavior problems, concentration problems, socialï¿½emotional functioning, and prosocial behavior using the Teacher Observation of Classroom Adaptationï¿½Checklist (TOCAï¿½C; Koth, Bradshaw, & Leaf, 2009). LPA revealed 4 latent classes: high-risk (6.6%), at-risk (23.3%), normative (36.5%), and sociallyï¿½emotionally skilled (33.6%). LPA membership was found to have a moderating impact on childrenï¿½s subsequent discipline problems and need for and use of school-based services.

They were randomly assigned to either a six-week exercise intervention (low-intensity running three times a week, n = 49) or wait list (no intervention, n = 48). All participants were measured before the intervention (T0), and immediately after the intervention (T1). Exercisers were also investigated 4 weeks (T2) and 12 weeks (T3) after the intervention.RESULTS: Participants in the exercise condition showed a larger decrease in two of the three indicators of study-related fatigue (i.e., overall fatigue and need for recovery) as compared to controls. Additionally, sleep quality and some indicators of cognitive functioning improved more among exercisers than among controls. No effects were found for self-efficacy, and physical fitness. The initial effects of the exercise intervention lasted at follow-up (T2 and T3). At 12-week follow up (T3), 80% of participants in the exercise condition still engaged in regular exercise, and further enhancements were seen for emotional exhaustion, overall fatigue, and sleep quality.CONCLUSIONS: These results underline the value of low-intensity exercise for university students with high levels of study-related fatigue.

3030930,USA/Canada,Middle/High School,Behaviour and Social Wellbeing,"In this study, we randomly assigned 123 sixth and seventh grade classrooms from seven middle schools in the greater Cleveland area to one of two five-session curricula addressing gender violence/sexual harassment (GV/SH) or to a no-treatment control group. A baseline survey and two follow-up surveys were administered immediately after the treatment (Wave 2) and about six months posttreatment (Wave 3). In an earlier paper, we demonstrated the effectiveness of two approaches to youth GV/SH prevention programming (a fact-based, law and justice curriculum and an interaction-based curriculum). In this paper, we explored whether these largely positive findings remain for both girls and boys, including whether girls experience higher levels of GV/SH than boys. Most of our statistical models proved to be non-statistically significant. However, in 2 of our 48 victimization/ perpetration (any violence, sexual violence and non-sexual violence) models (across two post-intervention follow-up points), we observed that the interventions reduced peer (male or female, non-dating partner) sexual violence victimization and reduced peer perpetration, but another outcome model indicated that the interventions increased dating perpetration. These mixed findings will need to be explored further in future research. Regarding our primary research question, we observed no statistically significant differences for the treatment multiplied by gender interaction terms for any of the perpetration or victimization outcome models, suggesting that the treatment had similar effects on girls and boys. However, we did observe that boys are more involved in violence than girls: both as victims and perpetrators. Boys experienced significantly more of three types of victimization from peers and dating partners compared to what girls experienced at the hands of their peers and dating partners. As perpetrators, boys committed more sexual victimization against peers (immediately post-intervention only) and more sexual victimization against dating partners than girls.

A multi-center trial of the efficacy of different computer-based instructional strategies gave us the opportunity to observe institutional and student factors linked to attrition from a study and the ways in which they altered the participation profile. The data is from a randomized controlled trial conducted at seven US medical schools investigating the educational impact of different instructional designs for computer-based learning modules for surgical clerks. All students undertaking their surgical clerkships at the participating schools were invited participate and those that consented were asked to complete five study measures during their surgery clerkship. Variations in study attrition rates were explored by institution and by participantsï¿½ self-regulation, self-efficacy, perception of task value, and mastery goal orientation measured on entry to the study. Of the 1,363 invited participants 995 (73 %) consented to participate and provided baseline data. There was a significant drop in the rate of participation at each of the five study milestones with 902 (94 %) completing at least one of two module post-test, 799 (61 %) both module post-tests, 539 (36 %) the mid-rotation evaluation and 252 (25 %) the final evaluation. Attrition varied between institutions on survival analysis (p < 0.001). Small but statistically significant differences in self-regulation (p = 0.01), self-efficacy (p = 0.02) and task value (p = 0.04) were observed but not in mastery or performance goal orientation measures (p = NS). Study attrition was correlated with lower achievement on the National Board of Medical Examiners subject exam.

Students in the treated classes were taught a course in finance and interviewed before and after the study, while controls were only interviewed. Our principal result is that the difference-in-difference estimates of the effect of the course are not statistically significant. However, the course in finance reduces the virtual demand for cash and increases the level of financial literacy and the propensity to read (and the capacity to understand) economic articles in both treated and control classes compared with pre-treatment baseline levels.

DESIGN: A cluster randomised controlled trial with repeated cross-sectional design and a 12-month follow-up. Primary outcomes were breakfast skipping, breakfast diet and episodic memory. Secondary outcomes were frequency of eating breakfast at home and at school, breakfast attitudes, rest-of-day diet and class behaviour. SETTING: Primary schools in nine local education authority areas. SUBJECTS: A total of 4350 students (aged 9-11 years) at baseline and 4472 at follow-up in 111 schools. RESULTS: Students in intervention schools reported significantly higher numbers of healthy food items consumed at breakfast and more positive attitudes towards breakfast eating at 12 months. Parents in intervention schools reported significantly higher rates of consumption of breakfast at school and correspondingly lower rates of breakfast consumption at home. No other significant differences were found. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention did not reduce breakfast skipping; rather, pupils substituted breakfast at home for breakfast at school. However, there were improvements in children's nutritional intake at breakfast time, if not the rest of the day, and more positive attitudes to breakfast, which may have implications for life-course dietary behaviours.

3031182,Rest of Europe,Special School,Study-Related Skills,"Background: When compared with more traditional instructional methods, Game-based e-learning (GbEl) promises a higher motivation of learners by presenting contents in an interactive, rule-based and competitive way. Most recent systematic reviews and meta-analysis of studies on Game-based learning and GbEl in the medical professions have shown limited effects of these instructional methods. Objectives: To compare the effectiveness on the learning outcome of a Game-based e-learning (GbEl) instruction with a conventional script-based instruction in the teaching of phase contrast microscopy urinalysis under routine training conditions of undergraduate medical students. Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 145 medical students in their third year of training in the Department of Urology at the University Medical Center Freiburg Germany. 82 subjects where allocated for training with an educational adventure-game (GbEl group) and 69 subjects for conventional training with a written scriptbased approach (script group). Learning outcome was measured with a 34 item single choice test. Students' attitudes were collected by a questionnaire regarding fun with the training, motivation to continue the training and selfassessment of acquired knowledge. Results: The students in the GbEl group achieved significantly better results in the cognitive knowledge test than the students in the script group: the mean score was 28.6 for the GbEl group and 26.0 for the script group of a total of 34.0 points with a Cohen's d effect size of 0.71 (ITT analysis). Attitudes towards the recent learning experience were significantly more positive with GbEl. Students reported to have more fun while learning with the game when compared to the script-based approach. Conclusions: Game-based e-learning is more effective than a script-based approach for the training of urinalysis in regard to cognitive learning outcome and has a high positive motivational impact on learning.

In this study, we have set up a group-randomized controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of a board game for learning FA. Methods: Four class groups (120 students) were randomly assigned to 2 conditions, a board game or a traditional lecture method (control condition). The effect of the learning environment on students&apos; achievement was examined through a paper-and-pencil test of FA knowledge. Two months after the intervention, the participants took a retention test and completed a questionnaire assessing enjoyment, interest, and motivation.

Statistical significance was reached for skim milk (P = 0.03) and for pure orange juice (P = 0.05). Boys of both the intervention and control groups failed to improve their intake of healthy foods, but those of the intervention arm significantly reduced their intake of hamburgers and hot dogs (P = 0.001). Conclusions: Girls were more amenable to improving their dietary intake. Overall, the program was more likely to increase consumption of healthy food than to decrease intake of unhealthy foods.

8154394,Rest of Europe,Primary/Elementary,Range of Academic Outcomes,"Background. As revealed by national surveys and comparisons with other countries, Italian students may have difficulties in learning mathematical content, and geometry in particular. Aim. This research aimed at ascertaining if, with respect to traditional methods, the structural characteristics of simulation games designed on the basis of specific theoretical and methodological choices can: (a) facilitate comprehension and improve the retention of geometric concepts ; (b) increase pupils' motivation to learn geometry; (c) affect perceived social and scholastic self-efficacy . Method. This mixed method research included an experimental and a control group and a qualitative analysis of an open-ended examination. Results. Our research with Y4 primary pupils (n=104) indicates that students who learned geometrical concepts via the simulation game had a higher level of both content retention and level of abstraction compared with those in the control group.

The study addresses the pressing need for empirical examination of ecologically valid, secondary intervention practices in this area. Thirty female youth in grades 6ï¿½8 (ages 12ï¿½15 years) and their parents were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (N = 22) or a wait list control group (N = 12). Changes in self, teacher and school counselor reported relationally aggressive behavior from pretest to posttest was compared across groups for statistical and clinically significant change. Intervention participants demonstrated significantly more change in the desired direction than control participants according to school counselors and an averaged score of school counselor and teacher-reported relational aggression. We discuss the clinical significance findings and implications of perceptual data from social validity surveys of each intervention component.

3031032,NA,NA,NA,"The objective of the present thesis was to carry out a controlled evaluation of the impact of a new goal-setting intervention on clients' participation in and benefits from the process of career counselling. Goal setting is a technique originally developed by researchers in industrial and organizational psychology to help managers motivate employees to set difficult but reachable goals and thereby improve their work-related performance. The present thesis marked one of the first times that goal-setting had been adapted to and rigorously evaluated within career counselling. The thesis involved random assignment of subjects to either a control (n = 31) or an experimental (n = 32) group. The control group received the standard, group-oriented, career-counselling program that is offered at the University of Ottawa Career and Counselling Services (UOCCS), where the study was conducted. The experimental group, received in addition to the standard UOCCS career counselling program, a new collaborative (counsellor-client) goal-setting intervention that included feedback to subjects on progress towards the attainment of their goals. The intervention aimed at increasing the amount of time spent by clients on self-chosen career-counselling activities and, thereby, the overall benefits derived from the career-counselling process. It was anticipated that goal-setting would help counsellors to motivate clients to set specific, challenging, but attainable career-counselling goals and to pursue and implement these goals. The basic hypothesis was that subjects in the experimental (goal-setting) group, compared with those in the control group, would participate to a greater extent in and obtain greater benefits from the career-counselling process. Participation was operationalized as an equally weighed combination of the total amount of time spent on career-counselling activities and the total number of activities engaged in. The following variables were used as career-counselling outcomes: satisfaction with services, number of problem issues interfering with career decision-making, career decidedness, degree of comfort with level of career decidedness, self-clarity about interests and abilities, knowledge of pertinent occupations and training, decisiveness, career-choice importance, and objectives in coming for career counselling (i.e., gaining reassurance on the appropriateness of career options, expanding or narrowing career options, exploring 'backup' career options, deciding on an academic major, and gaining an understanding of occupational interests and abilities). The results of t-tests and a series of split-plot ANOVAS revealed that there was no significant effect (at the p < .05) of treatment on participation in career counselling or on any of the 15 career-counselling outcomes. It therefore seems appropriate to regard the two interventions (i.e., goal-setting plus group career counselling, versus group career counselling alone), as about equally (rather than differentially) effective in motivating students to participate in, and thereby benefit from, the career-counselling process. Although there was no main effect for treatment, a series of hierarchial regressions revealed significant interactions between treatment and level of conscientiousness. The goal-setting intervention produced greater benefits than the control condition (i.e., greater participation in career counselling), but only for subjects low in conscientiousness. The failure to find differential benefits should not lead one to conclude that the programs were not effective (even though the absence of a no-intervention control group does not allow us to say just how effective they were, compared with no career counselling program at all).

3030677,UK/Ireland,College/University,Professional Training,"The aim of this study was to detect a difference in knowledge gain between students receiving structured versus student-directed learning for the two-week Child Health outpatient module. A total of 138 phase 3 (year 4) medical students in 10 two-week paediatric outpatient blocks at the Department of Child Health, University of Dundee, Scotland, were randomized to student-directed or structured learning between January and December 2002. Pre- and post-course tests were administered at the start and the end of the attachment; 129 students sat both tests. Results are presented as mean scores with standard deviations or 95% confidence intervals (CI) in parentheses. The primary outcome measure was gain in knowledge of the Child Health core curriculum that is covered in the outpatient setting. Although pre-course scores were similar (student-directed 25.3 (7.3); structured 24.8 (7.5)) the structured approach resulted in higher post-course scores in comparison with the student-directed approach (student-directed 41.8 (9.4); structured 53.8 (8.8); p < 0.01). Knowledge gain showed significant differences between the two learning approaches (student-directed 16.5 (3.7); structured 29.1 (3.8), difference = 12.6 (95% CI 11.3 to 13.9)). Low pre-course scores or gender did not affect knowledge gain. In the Child Health outpatient setting, the 'traditional' structured approach led to significantly greater knowledge gain in comparison with the 'novel' student-directed approach.

3031154,USA/Canada,Middle/High School,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"BACKGROUND: The Hutchinson Study of High School Smoking randomized trial was designed to rigorously evaluate a proactive, personalized telephone counseling intervention for adolescent smoking cessation. METHODS: Fifty randomly selected Washington State high schools were randomized to the experimental or control condition. High school junior smokers were proactively identified (N = 2151). Trained counselors delivered the motivational interviewing plus cognitive behavioral skills training telephone intervention to smokers in experimental schools during their senior year of high school. Participants were followed up, with 88.8% participation, to outcome ascertainment more than 1 year after random assignment. The main outcome was 6-months prolonged abstinence from smoking. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: The intervention increased the percentage who achieved 6-month prolonged smoking abstinence among all smokers (21.8% in the experimental condition vs 17.7% in the control condition, difference = 4.0%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.2 to 8.1, P = .06) and in particular among daily smokers (10.1% vs 5.9%, difference = 4.1%, 95% CI = 0.8 to 7.1, P = .02). There was also generally strong evidence of intervention impact for 3-month, 1-month, and 7-day abstinence and duration since last cigarette (P = .09, .015, .01, and .03, respectively). The intervention effect was strongest among male daily smokers and among female less-than-daily smokers. CONCLUSIONS: Proactive identification and recruitment of adolescents via public high schools can produce a high level of intervention reach; a personalized motivational interviewing plus cognitive behavioral skills training counseling intervention delivered by counselor-initiated telephone calls is effective in increasing teen smoking cessation; and both daily and less-than-daily teen smokers participate in and benefit from telephone-based smoking cessation intervention.","Group-randomized trial of a proactive, personalized telephone counseling intervention for adolescent smoking cessation","https://www.google.com/search?q=Group-randomized+trial+of+a+proactive,+personalized+telephone+counseling+intervention+for+adolescent+smoking+cessation",2009,Targeted,External Educators,Full Academic Year or Longer,None,None,Clustered,2151,50,Yes,Some Sub-Groups Reported,At Least Some Follow-Up,Yes,No,"Yes, Theoretical Perspectives",Yes,USA/Canada Middle/High School Physical Health and Wellbeing
3031249,NA,NA,NA,"In 1987 a small health education research team in Montpellier became interested in AIDS prevention among high school students (15-19 years old). Studies at that time indicated that the majority of the youth were relatively well informed about AIDS, for example 99% of those questioned knew that the disease was transmitted by sexual intercourse or by the exchange of contaminated needles. Further studies indicated, however, that the young people did not feel that the subject concerned them personally--it was considered a problem like many others. The team decided therefore to design a programme which would involve the young people, and thus motivate them not only to question, but to look for answers and implicate themselves in the search for information. The programme design consisted in creating video workshops in selected high schools. Adults with different backgrounds were trained in video production and communication skills in order to develop sufficient staff for workshop supervision. A network of available specialists was recruited for consulting purposes and a specialized library which included audiovisual materials was created so that the young people would have sufficient resources available for their research. In order to incite the students to contemplate the subject of AIDS and all that it involves, a contest was held. The theme was simply, 'AIDS' and the duration was the length of the 1988-89 school year. Eight workshops were created in eight different schools. The teams were created quite spontaneously and the dynamic of interrogation anticipated was realized. With the help of trained adult supervisors, each team started their project by designing a five minute video.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Health education and AIDS.

climate and the physical and sedentary behaviour of primary school students after the implementation of an
innovative education programme regarding nutrition and physical activity.
Design: Randomised controlled trial.
Setting: Study participants were 729 students, aged 8–10 years, in the third and fourth grade of 30 public
primary schools in the Athens Metropolitan Area.
Methods: Students were randomly assigned to three study groups: an Intensive Intervention Group (IIG)
that underwent an intensive nutrition and physical activity education programme delivered by specialised
personnel and teachers, an Intervention Group (IG) that underwent a less intensive programme delivered
by their regular teacher and a Control Group (CG) that received no instruction. Classroom Psychological
Climate (CPC) was measured in all groups, and the data regarding physical activity and sedentary lifestyle
habits, such as the time spent viewing TV or video games (screen time), were recorded.
Results: Friction declined and satisfaction increased significantly after the intervention in the IG compared
with the CG. There was no significant difference in physical activity and screen time between the groups.
Daily screen time was positively associated with increased friction, which is a measure of conflicts between
students in the school environment.
Conclusion: A school nutrition and physical activity education programme was shown to decrease friction by
decreasing daily screen time and increasing outdoor activities. These findings also suggest that teachers alone may
be more effective in delivering optional health education programmes than specialised personnel and instructors.","Health education: Effects on

The control group received the audiometric testing. RESULTS: Students exposed to the hearing conservation program reported more frequent use of hearing protection devices, but there was no evidence of reduced levels of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). CONCLUSION: Our analysis suggests that, since NIHL is cumulative, a 3-year study was likely not long enough to evaluate the efficacy of this intervention.

A previous study published by the authors showed that a single intervention could not change the baseline attitudes toward neurotrauma prevention. The present study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of multiple interventions in modifying knowledge and attitudes for the prevention of neurotrauma in Brazilian preteens and adolescents. Methods. In a randomized controlled trial, fifth-year primary school (PS) and second-year high school (HS) students were divided into a control and 2 intervention (single/multiple) groups. The study was conducted in the following 8 stages: T1, questionnaire to measure baseline characteristics; T2, lecture on trauma prevention; T3, reapplying the questionnaire used in T1; T4, Traffic Department intervention; T5, a play about trauma and its consequences; T6, Fire Department intervention; T7, Emergency Medical Service intervention; and T8, reapplying the questionnaire used in T1 and T3. Positive answers were considered those affirming the use of safety devices 'always or sometimes' and negative as 'never' using safety devices. Results. The sample consisted of 535 students. Regarding attitudes, students in all groups at any stage of measurement showed protective behavior more than 95% of the time about seat belt use. There were only differences between attitudes in PS and HS students on T8 assessment concerning the use of safety equipment on bikes in the multiple-intervention group and concerning the use of safety equipment on skateboards and rollerblades in single-and multiple-intervention groups. These differences were caused mainly by the reduction in positive answers by the HS group, rather than by the increase in positive or protective answers by the PS group. However, there was no difference when the control and intervention groups were compared, independent of the attitudes or the student groups studied. The most important reason for not using protective devices was the belief that they would not get hurt. Conclusions. Multiple and different types of educational interventions, such as lectures, scenes from plays about trauma and its consequences, traffic and fire department intervention, and medical emergency intervention directed to preteens and adolescents from public and private schools did not modify most students' attitudes toward injury prevention.

DESIGN: A cluster-randomised controlled trial design was used. The NFVPP consisted of three intervention arms: (i) Intervention I: Free Fruit and Vegetable Snack (FFVS) + Enhanced Nutrition Education; (ii) Intervention II: FFVS-alone; and (iii) Control group. Using the Pro-Children Questionnaire, the primary outcome measure was children's fruit and vegetable consumption, and the secondary outcome measures included differences in children's awareness, knowledge, self-efficacy, preference, intention and willingness to increase fruit and vegetable consumption. SETTING/SUBJECTS: Twenty-six elementary schools in a defined area of Northern Ontario were eligible to participate in the impact evaluation. A final sample size of 1,277 students in grades five to eight was achieved. RESULTS: Intervention I students consumed more fruit and vegetables at school than their Control counterparts by 0.49 serving/d (P < 0.05).

Latest studies have proposed potential benefits offered by innovative 3D technology. To date there is no research dedicated to quantify an impact of training using 3-D over conventional practice. The goal of this study is to analyse the influence of 3-D training on beginner's performance in 2-D laparoscopic simulation. Methods A Total of thirty-two (32) medical students (novices) were selected and equally divided in Group A and Group B to complete 3 FLS tasks: Peg transfer, Pattern cutting, and Intra- corporeal suturing, using validated 2-D and 3-D models. The phase 1 comprised 5 attempts, in which group A applied the 3-D system, and group B the 2-D system. The second phase consisted of 3 attempts using exclusively the 2-D system for both groups. The mean value of time completion (seconds), mean error rate, and efficiency improvement (%) were assessed. Student T-test was used to calculate the results.

Aims: To examine whether, and through which mechanisms, targeting risk factors in early childhood prevents substance use across adolescence. Method: Disruptive kindergarten boys (n = 172) living in Montreal were randomly allocated to a preventive intervention and a control condition. The intervention was delivered over 2 years (7ï¿½9 years of age) with two main components: (a) social and problem-solving skills training for the boys; and (b) training for parents on effective child-rearing skills. Results: Adolescent substance use, up to 8 years post-intervention, was reduced in those who received the intervention (d = 0.48ï¿½0.70). Of most interest, the intervention effects were explained partly by reductions in impulsivity, antisocial behaviour and affiliation with less deviant peers during pre-adolescence (11ï¿½13 years). Conclusions: Adolescent substance use may be indirectly prevented by selectively targeting childhood risk factors that disrupt the developmental cascade of adolescent risk factors for substance use.

5132909,USA/Canada,Middle/High School,Behaviour and Social Wellbeing,"Objective: This study evaluated the effectiveness of a school-based mental health literacy intervention for adolescents on knowledge and stigma. Method: A total of 24 high schools and 534 students in the regional area of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada participated in this randomized controlled trial. Schools were randomly assigned to either the curriculum or control condition. The curriculum was integrated into the province's grade 11 and 12 'Healthy Living' courses and was delivered by teachers. Changes in mental health knowledge and stigma were measured using pre- and posttest questionnaires. Descriptive analyses were conducted to provide sample characteristics, and multilevel modeling was used to examine study outcomes. Results: For the curriculum condition, there was a significant change in stigma scores over time (p = .001), with positive attitudes toward mental illness increasing from pre to post. There was also a significant change in knowledge scores over time (p < .001), with knowledge scores increasing from pre to post. No significant changes in knowledge or stigma were found for participants in the control condition. A meaningful relationship was found whereby increases in knowledge significantly predicted increases in positive attitudes toward mental health (p < .001). Conclusion: This is the first large randomized controlled trial to demonstrate the effectiveness in mental health literacy of an integrated, manualized mental health educational resource for high school students on knowledge and stigma. Findings also support the applicability by teachers and suggest the potential for broad-based implementation of the educational curriculum in high schools.

3031132,USA/Canada,Primary/Elementary,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"BACKGROUND: Underserved children, particularly girls and those in urban communities, do not meet the recommended physical activity guidelines (>60min of daily physical activity), and this behavior can lead to obesity. The school years are known to be a critical period in the life course for shaping attitudes and behaviors. Children look to schools for much of their access to physical activity. Thus, through the provision of appropriate physical activity programs, schools have the power to influence apt physical activity choices, especially for underserved children where disparities in obesity-related outcomes exist. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of a nurse directed, coordinated, culturally sensitive, school-based, family-centered lifestyle program on activity behaviors and body mass index. DESIGN, SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a parallel group, randomized controlled trial utilizing a community-based participatory research approach, through a partnership with a University and 5 community schools. Participants included 251 children ages 8-12 from elementary schools in urban, low-income neighborhoods in Los Angeles, USA. METHODS: The intervention included Kids N Fitness(ï¿½), a 6-week program which met weekly to provide 45min of structured physical activity and a 45min nutrition education class for parents and children. Intervention sites also participated in school-wide wellness activities, including health and counseling services, staff professional development in health promotion, parental education newsletters, and wellness policies for the provision of healthy foods at the school. The Child and Adolescent Trial for Cardiovascular Health School Physical Activity and Nutrition Student Questionnaire measured physical activity behavior, including: daily physical activity, participation in team sports, attending physical education class, and TV viewing/computer game playing. Anthropometric measures included height, weight, body mass index, resting blood pressure, and waist circumference. Measures were collected at baseline, completion of the intervention phase (4 months), and 12 months post-intervention. RESULTS: Significant results for students in the intervention, included for boys decreases in TV viewing; and girls increases in daily physical activity, physical education class attendance, and decreases in body mass index z-scores from baseline to the 12 month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows the value of utilizing nurses to implement a culturally sensitive, coordinated, intervention to decrease disparities in activity and TV viewing among underserved girls and boys.","Impact of a nurse-directed, coordinated school health program to enhance physical activity behaviors and reduce body mass index among minority children: a parallel-group, randomized control trial","https://www.google.com/search?q=Impact+of+a+nurse-directed,+coordinated+school+health+program+to+enhance+physical+activity+behaviors+and+reduce+body+mass+index+among+minority+children:+a+parallel-group,+randomized+control+trial",2013,Targeted,Other School/College Employees,Up to Half a Term,Behaviour and Social Wellbeing,None,Single,251,NA,Yes,Some Sub-Groups Reported,At Least Some Follow-Up,Yes,"Yes, But Not Reported","Yes, Theoretical Perspectives",No,USA/Canada Primary/Elementary Physical Health and Wellbeing

However, prevention is possible and for this reason the WHO Action Programme on Essential Drugs aims to improve the teaching of pharmacotherapy to medical students. The impact of a short problem-based training course in pharmacotherapy, using a WHO manual on the principles of rational prescribing, was measured in an international multi-centre randomised controlled study of 219 undergraduate medical students in Groningen (Netherlands), Kathmandu (Nepal), Lagos (Nigeria), Newcastle (Australia), New Delhi (India), San Francisco (USA), and Yogyakarta (Japan). The manual and the course presented the students, who were about to enter the clinical phase of their studies, with a normative model for pharmacotherapeutic reasoning in which they were taught to generate a 'standard' pharmacotherapeutic approach to common disorders, resulting in a set of first-choice drugs called P(ersonal)-drugs. The students were then taught how to apply this set of P-drugs to specific patient problems on the symptomatic treatment of pain, using a six-step problem-solving routine. The impact of the course was measured by tests before training, immediately after, and six months later. After the course, students from the study group performed significantly better than controls in all patient problems presented (p < 0.05). The students not only remembered how to solve old problems, but they could also apply their skills to new problems. Both retention and transfer effect were maintained at least six months after the training session in all seven medical schools. In view of the impossibility of teaching students all basic knowledge on the thousands of drugs available, this approach seems to be an efficient way of teaching rational prescribing. However, the method should be accompanied by a change in teaching methods away from the habit of transferring knowledge about the drugs towards problem-based teaching of therapeutic reasoning.",Impact of a short course in pharmacotherapy for undergraduate medical students: an international randomised controlled study,https://www.google.com/search?q=Impact+of+a+short+course+in+pharmacotherapy+for+undergraduate+medical+students:+an+international+randomised+controlled+study,1995,Universal,Regular Teachers/Lecturers,More than One Term,none,none,Single,219,NA,Yes,Whole Sample Only,At Least Some Follow-Up,Yes,"Yes, Fairly Well","Yes, Descriptive Theory of Change",Yes,Multiple College/University Professional Training

The 'Positive Action' Hawai'i trial included 20 racially/ethnically diverse schools (M enrollment = 544) and was conducted from the 2002-03 through the 2005-06 academic years. Using school-level archival data, analyses comparing change from baseline (2002) to 1-year posttrial (2007) revealed that intervention schools scored 9.8% better on the TerraNova (2nd ed.) test for reading and 8.8% on math, that 20.7% better in Hawai'i Content and Performance Standards scores for reading and 51.4% better in math, and that intervention schools reported 15.2% lower absenteeism and fewer suspensions (72.6%) and retentions (72.7%). Overall, effect sizes were moderate to large (range = 0.5-1.1) for all of the examined outcomes.

This may lead to misjudgements of priorities and delays in CPR performance, which further increase mental stress. Interventions to stop this vicious cycle by reducing stress and its negative consequences are largely lacking. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that a task focusing strategy would lower perceived stress levels of rescuers and thereby improve performance during a simulated CPR scenario. Methods: This prospective, randomized-controlled trial was conducted at the simulator center of the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland.

3031562,Central/South America,Primary/Elementary,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"To control soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections, the World Health Organization recommends school-based deworming programs with a health hygiene education component. The effect of such health hygiene interventions, however, has not been adequately studied. The objective of the present study was to determine the effectiveness of a health hygiene education intervention on the occurrence of STH re-infection four months post-de-worming. An open-label pair-matched cluster-randomized trial was conducted in Grade 5 schoolchildren of 18 primary schools (9 intervention and 9 control) in the Peruvian Amazon. Baseline assessment included interview with a pre-tested questionnaire and collection of single stool specimens that were examined using the single Kato-Katz thick smear. All schoolchildren were then treated with single-dose albendazole (400 mg). Schoolchildren in intervention schools then received 1) an initial one hour in-class activity on health hygiene and sanitation and 30-minute refresher activities every two weeks over four months; and 2) a half-day workshop for teachers and principals, while children in control schools did not. Four months later, STH infection was re-assessed in all schools by laboratory technologists blinded to intervention status. From April 21-October 20, 2010, a total of 1,089 schoolchildren (518 and 571 from intervention and control schools, respectively) participated in this study.

3031012,USA/Canada,Middle/High School,Range of Academic Outcomes,"Purpose: To determine whether a school-wide intervention program to reduce risk factors for type 2 diabetes (T2D) affected student achievement, rates of disciplinary actions, and attendance rates. Design: The HEALTHY primary prevention trial was designed to evaluate a comprehensive school-based intervention to reduce factors for T2D, especially overweight and obesity. Students were followed up from beginning of sixth grade (Fall 2006) through end of eighth grade (Spring 2009). Setting: Forty-two middle schools at seven U.S. sites. Subjects: Schools were randomized in equal numbers at each site to intervention (21 schools, 2307 students) or control (21 schools, 2296 students). Intervention: An integrated school-wide program that focused on (1) foods and beverages, (2) physical education, (3) classroom-based behavior change and education, and (4) social marketing communication and promotional campaigns. Measures: Aggregate (grade- and school-wide) test performance (passing rate), attendance, and referrals for disciplinary actions. Analysis: Descriptive statistics and tests of intervention versus control using mixed linear models methods to adjust for the clustering of students within schools. Results: There were no differences between intervention and control schools in test performance for mathematics (p = .7835) or reading (p = .6387), attendance (p = .5819), or referrals for disciplinary action (p = .8671). Conclusion: The comprehensive HEALTHY intervention and associated research procedures did not negatively impact student achievement test scores, attendance, or referrals for disciplinary action.

3031227,USA/Canada,College/University,Professional Training,"Purpose: To address whether increasingly authentic instructional formats are more effective in improving preclerkship medical students' performance. Method: From 2007 to 2009, the authors conducted a prospective, randomized, crossover study with second-year medical students in a clinical reasoning course at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences. The authors randomly assigned students to one of three cohorts and used instructional formats of differing authenticity (paper, DVD, standardized patient) to teach three subject areas (abdominal pain, anemia, polyuria). Each cohort received one instructional format for each subject area. The authors collected outcome measures (objective structured clinical exam, video quiz, and essay exam scores) at the end of each academic year. They stratified the students into tertiles by first-year grade point average to investigate the impact of instructional formats on learners of different abilities. Results: Outcomes for students in the top tertile improved with increased authenticity of the instructional format compared with outcomes for students in the middle and bottom tertiles (0.188 versus -0.038 and -0.201, P = .001 and .027, respectively). However, outcomes for students in the bottom tertile decreased when students were given only the paper case, compared with the middle and top tertiles (-0.374 versus 0.043 and 0.023, respectively, P = .001), but subsequently improved with more authentic instructional formats. Conclusions: The authors could not demonstrate that increased authenticity of the instructional format resulted in improved learner performance.

3031290,Africa,Primary/Elementary,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"Background:Improving the health of school-aged children can yield substantial benefits for cognitive development and educational achievement. However, there is limited experimental evidence of the benefits of alternative school-based malaria interventions or how the impacts of interventions vary according to intensity of malaria transmission. We investigated the effect of intermittent screening and treatment (IST) for malaria on the health and education of school children in an area of low to moderate malaria transmission.Methods and Findings:A cluster randomised trial was implemented with 5,233 children in 101 government primary schools on the south coast of Kenya in 2010-2012. The intervention was delivered to children randomly selected from classes 1 and 5 who were followed up for 24 months. Once a school term, children were screened by public health workers using malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), and children (with or without malaria symptoms) found to be RDT-positive were treated with a six dose regimen of artemether-lumefantrine (AL). Given the nature of the intervention, the trial was not blinded. The primary outcomes were anaemia and sustained attention. Secondary outcomes were malaria parasitaemia and educational achievement. Data were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis.During the intervention period, an average of 88.3% children in intervention schools were screened at each round, of whom 17.5% were RDT-positive. 80.3% of children in the control and 80.2% in the intervention group were followed-up at 24 months. No impact of the malaria IST intervention was observed for prevalence of anaemia at either 12 or 24 months (adjusted risk ratio [Adj.RR]: 1.03, 95% CI 0.93-1.13, p = 0.621 and Adj.RR: 1.00, 95% CI 0.90-1.11, p = 0.953) respectively, or on prevalence of P. falciparum infection or scores of classroom attention. No effect of IST was observed on educational achievement in the older class, but an apparent negative effect was seen on spelling scores in the younger class at 9 and 24 months and on arithmetic scores at 24 months.Conclusion:In this setting in Kenya, IST as implemented in this study is not effective in improving the health or education of school children. Possible reasons for the absence of an impact are the marked geographical heterogeneity in transmission, the rapid rate of reinfection following AL treatment, the variable reliability of RDTs, and the relative contribution of malaria to the aetiology of anaemia in this setting.Trial registration:www.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00878007Please see later in the article for the Editors' Summary. 2014 Halliday et al.",Impact of Intermittent Screening and Treatment for Malaria among School Children in Kenya: A Cluster Randomised Trial,https://www.google.com/search?q=Impact+of+Intermittent+Screening+and+Treatment+for+Malaria+among+School+Children+in+Kenya:+A+Cluster+Randomised+Trial,2014,Universal,Mixture,Up to Half a Term,Range of Academic Outcomes,None,Clustered,5233,101,No,Some Sub-Groups Reported,At Least Some Follow-Up,Yes,No,No,No,Africa Primary/Elementary Physical Health and Wellbeing

Second-year medical undergraduates (n = 90) of Avicenna Medical College were randomised to movie-based simulation training (group B, n = 30), traditional verbal training alone (group C, n=30), and a combination (group A, n = 30). The scores were marked by observers using a standardised key and were compared for performance at 2 observed OSPE stations. Group B and A performed significantly better than group C on station 1 and 2. Gender factor did not seem to influence the score.

5132495,USA/Canada,Middle/High School,Other School Subjects,"The 'Framework for K-12 Science Education' (National Research Council, 2012) sets an ambitious vision for science learning by emphasizing that for students to achieve proficiency in science they will need to participate in the authentic practices of scientists. To realize this vision, all students will need opportunities to learn from high-quality curriculum materials where they engage in science practices. We report on our study of a middle school curriculum called 'Project-Based Inquiry Science' that has some design features that match well with the new directions in science education. To measure the impact of these materials, we conducted a randomized controlled trial in sixth grade science classrooms across 42 schools in an urban school district. We randomly assigned schools to either a treatment condition where teachers implemented the project-based science curriculum or a comparison condition where teachers implemented the district-adopted textbook. Teachers in both conditions received professional development on the 'Framework'. Students who participated in the project-based science curriculum outperformed students in the comparison curriculum on outcome measures that were aligned to core science ideas and science practices in the 'Framework'. Importantly, the results show that project-based curriculum materials that incorporate science practices along with disciplinary content can help students achieve next generation science learning outcomes when there is coherence with district guidance about instruction. The study findings suggest that curriculum materials, district involvement, and support for teachers' implementation of new forms of instruction are important for realizing the vision and key principles of the 'Framework' in the context of a large and diverse urban school district.",Impact of Project-Based Curriculum Materials on Student Learning in Science: Results of a Randomized Controlled Trial,https://www.google.com/search?q=Impact+of+Project-Based+Curriculum+Materials+on+Student+Learning+in+Science:+Results+of+a+Randomized+Controlled+Trial,2015,Universal,Regular Teachers/Lecturers,Up to Half a Term,Range of Academic Outcomes,None,Clustered,1411,103,Yes,Some Sub-Groups Reported,Immediate Post-Test Only,Yes,No,"Yes, Theoretical Perspectives",No,USA/Canada Middle/High School Other School Subjects

for nursing students and evaluate the influence of this program on nursing students’ attitudes toward interprofessional
education and knowledge about operating room nursing.
Methods: Nursing students were randomly assigned to either the interprofessional simulation-based education or
traditional course group. A before-and-after study of nursing students’ attitudes toward the program was conducted
using the Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale. Responses to an open-ended question were categorized using
thematic content analysis. Nursing students’ knowledge about operating room nursing was measured.
Results: Nursing students from the interprofessional simulation-based education group showed statistically different
responses to four of the nineteen questions in the Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale, reflecting a more
positive attitude toward interprofessional learning. This was also supported by thematic content analysis of the
open-ended responses. Furthermore, nursing students in the simulation-based education group had a significant
improvement in knowledge about operating room nursing.
Conclusions: The integrated course with interprofessional education and simulation provided a positive impact
on undergraduate nursing students’ perceptions toward interprofessional learning and knowledge about
operating room nursing. Our study demonstrated that this course may be a valuable elective option for
undergraduate nursing students in operating room nursing education.","Implementation and evaluation of an

harm to the emotional and social well-being of students and
limit their ability to achieve their full academic potential. A
prior pilot study on the universal application of Coping Power
showed a significant decrease in the hyperactivity behaviors
of five classes. The next step was to test whether Coping
Power Universal could be successfully implemented by
teachers in a variety of Italian schools. The sample involved
40 third- and fourth-grade classes (901 students) from public
schools located in three Italian cities. Twenty classes were
randomly assigned to Coping Power Universal, and 20 classes
were randomly assigned to the control group, which received
the strictly standard academic curriculum of Italian elementary
schools. At each assessment period, the teachers completed
the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. The findings
showed a significant reduction in hyperactive and inattention
behaviors and conduct problems and emotional symptoms in
the intervention classes compared with the control classes.
This study suggests that Coping Power model can be delivered
in school settings at both universal and targeted prevention
levels and that in this multi-tiered prevention model,

We undertook an interventional study aimed at improving students' attitudes towards their disabled peers. Method: The participants were students from the 7th grade of twelve paired schools (1509 students from 62 classes; age 12-13y), randomly allocated to an intervention group (205 males, 285 females) or a control group (132 males, 165 females). The intervention consisted of a mandatory comprehensive educational project on disability. The Chedoke-McMaster Attitudes Towards Children with Handicaps Scale (CATCH) was used to assess children's attitudes before (T0) and after (T1) intervention. The hierarchical structure of the data was taken into account by adjusting standard deviations and using linear multilevel models. Results: Seven hundred and eighty-four students had at least one score on the three domains (cognitive, affective, behavioural) of the CATCH at T0 and T1. The final scores were higher than baseline scores (total scores, intervention group: baseline score 25.6 (SD=5.4), final score 26.8 (5.9), p less than 0.001; Control group: baseline 25.2 (5.4), final 26.0 (5.7), p less than 0.009) with no significant difference between the intervention and control groups.

Aims To establish the effectiveness of explicit speech and language therapy with visual support for secondary school-aged children with language impairments focusing on comprehension of coordinating conjunctions in a randomized control trial with an assessor blind to group status. Methods & Procedures Fourteen participants (aged 11;3-16;1) with severe RELI (mean standard scores: CELF4 ELS = 48, CELF4 RLS = 53 and TROG-2 = 57), but higher non-verbal (Matrices = 83) and visual perceptual skills (Test of Visual Perceptual Skills (TVPS) = 86) were randomly assigned to two groups: therapy versus waiting controls. In Phase 1, the therapy group received eight 30-min individual sessions of explicit teaching with visual support (Shape Coding) with their usual SLT. In Phase 2, the waiting controls received the same therapy. The participants' comprehension was tested pre-, post-Phase 1 and post-Phase 2 therapy on (1) a specific test of the targeted conjunctions, (2) the TROG-2 and (3) a test of passives. Outcomes & Results After Phase 1, the therapy group showed significantly more progress than the waiting controls on the targeted conjunctions ( d = 1.6) and overall TROG-2 standard score ( d = 1.4). The two groups did not differ on the passives test. After Phase 2, the waiting controls made similar progress to those in the original therapy group, who maintained their previous progress. Neither group showed progress on passives. When the two groups were combined, significant progress was found on the specific conjunctions ( d = 1.3) and TROG-2 raw ( d = 1.1) and standard scores ( d = 0.9). Correlations showed no measures taken (including Matrices and TVPS) correlated significantly with progress on the targeted conjunctions or the TROG-2. Conclusions & Implications Four hours of Shape Coding therapy led to significant gains on comprehension of coordinating conjunctions which were maintained after 4 months. Given the significant progress at a group level and the lack of reliable predictors of progress, this approach could be offered to other children with similar difficulties to the participants. However, the intervention was delivered one-to-one by speech and language therapists, thus the effectiveness of this therapy method with other methods of delivery remains to be evaluated.

This study examined the effects of a comprehensive elementary school-wide social-emotional and character education program, Positive Action, on teacher, parent, and student perceptions of school safety and quality utilizing a matched-pair, cluster-randomized, controlled design. The Positive Action Hawai&apos;i trial included 20 racially/ethnically diverse schools and was conducted from 2002-2003 through 2005-2006. Methods: School-level archival data, collected by the Hawai&apos;i Department of Education, were used to examine program effects at 1-year post-trial. Teacher, parent, and student data were analyzed to examine indicators of school quality such as student safety and well-being, involvement, and satisfaction, as well as overall school quality. Matched-paired 't'-tests were used for the primary analysis, and sensitivity analyses included permutation tests and random-intercept growth curve models. Results: Analyses comparing change from baseline to 1-year post-trial revealed that intervention schools demonstrated significantly improved school quality compared to control schools, with 21%, 13%, and 16% better overall school quality scores as reported by teachers, parents, and students, respectively. Teacher, parent, and student reports on individual school-quality indicators showed improvement in student safety and well-being, involvement, satisfaction, quality student support, focused and sustained action, standards-based learning, professionalism and system capacity, and coordinated team work.

8154712,NA,NA,NA,"NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES: There is a need for increased opportunities for distance learning and asynchronous learning in undergraduate medical education. Students have many reasons for not being at their institution's main campus including visiting electives or rotations at other campuses. Online courses, particularly those that are asynchronous, can fill this need, but different strategies for effective instruction have not been studied extensively. Of particular interest are strategies that increase interactivity without overburdening faculty. The main objectives of this project are to: 1) Determine the feasibility of adding basic interaction to recorded lectures using a novel learning tool; and 2) Determine whether this interaction improves students' short- and intermediate-term knowledge and self-efficacy. We will determine these outcomes by performing a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing recorded lectures to an interactive lecture. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Clinical Therapeutics is an entirely online elective course available to all senior medical students at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. The course is almost entirely asynchronous and is available from the beginning of December until the end of March to coincide with the residency interview season. DESCRIPTION: The RCT involves comparing interactive lectures that use a novel program developed at the University of Wisconsin called 'Case Scenario/Critical Reader Builder' (CSCR) to matched recorded lectures without interaction. All students taking the Clinical Therapeutics course during the 2015-2016 academic year (n = 118) were randomized to the recorded lecture group (control) or the interactive lecture group (intervention). Students in the control group view a recorded lecture online with accompanying PowerPoint slides roughly 45 min in duration. The recorded lectures have example cases mixed throughout the lecture and faculty pose questions about the cases to learners in the recording. Students in the intervention group view the same components, however, the cases and questions are presented to them via CSCR which requires them to answer questions about the cases correctly before proceeding with the lecture. CSCR provides feedback for each correct and incorrect answer chosen. We selected five learning topics taught by five faculty members for this RCT: depression, hypertension, sexually transmitted diseases, skin and soft tissue infections, and vasopressors. Students were randomized to receive all five topics in either the control or intervention format. Following the completion of each topic, students answer a five-question multiple-choice quiz querying the most important content of the lecture. Students are asked as part of the evaluation, 'Overall this was an excellent session,' rated on a 4 point scale (1 = strongly agree to 4 = strongly disagree). In addition, the students complete a self-efficacy question, 'I am confident in my ability to treat a patient with [conditions described in the lecture]', rated on a 10-point scale (1 = Not at all Confident to 10 = Extremely Confident). Students are given the same five-question quiz 2 weeks after completion of the topic to determine intermediate-term knowledge. EVALUATION: The main outcome measure is difference in student short-term and intermediate-term knowledge, as measured by the five-question quizzes. Knowledge difference will be analyzed using repeated analysis of variance in order to account for the five matched lecture pairings. Self-efficacy in the topic area will be evaluated by the single confidence question, and learning session satisfaction will be assessed by student ratings of the sessions. Feasibility of the intervention will be evaluated by comparing the time it takes for students to complete the interactive learning session versus the recorded lecture, and the self-reported additional time it takes faculty to develop the interactive learning session. To date, intervention students have completed 89 interactive lectures with a rating of 1.28 (standard deviation 0.48). Control students have completed 76 recorded lectures with a rating of 1.44 (standard deviation 0.50). Faculty reported an average of 5.75 extra hours to develop the interactive content versus the lecture. DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED: Data obtained from this study will help inform the use of interactive methods for online medical student education. Early results show that students rate the interactive sessions highly and additional faculty time to prepare the sessions using CSCR is manageable. If this moderate amount of interactivity improves students' short-term and/or intermediate-term knowledge, we will have identified a basic online teaching method that increases learner knowledge without requiring a large amount of faculty time. If we find no increases in student knowledge, further investigations will focus on whether increased amounts of interactivity will improve online learning, understanding that this will be increasingly burdensome for faculty.",Improving online medical student learning through interaction: A randomized controlled trial,https://www.google.com/search?q=Improving+online+medical+student+learning+through+interaction:+A+randomized+controlled+trial,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA NA NA
3031446,Asia,Primary/Elementary,Literacy/English,"We evaluate a program that aims to improve children's reading skills by providing classes with age-appropriate reading material and incentivizing children to read through a 31 day read-a-thon. During the read-a-thon, the program significantly increases the propensity of children to read, causing 20 percent more children to have read a book in the last week at school and increasing the number of books read by 2.3 in the last week and 7.2 in the last month.

DESIGN: Cluster randomised controlled trial. SETTING: 24 mixed sex, state secondary schools in Avon, south west England. PARTICIPANTS: 1974 boys and 1820 girls in year 10 (14-15 year olds). INTERVENTION: Teachers gave a single lesson on emergency contraception to year 10 pupils. The teachers had previously received in-service training on giving the lesson. The pupils were actively involved during the lesson. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Questionnaires distributed to pupils at baseline and six months after the intervention assessed their knowledge of the correct time limits for hormonal emergency contraception and for use of the intrauterine device as emergency contraception, the proportion of pupils who were not virgins, the proportion who had used emergency contraception, and the pupils' intention to use emergency contraception in the future. RESULTS: The proportion of pupils knowing the correct time limits for both types of emergency contraception was significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group at six months' follow up (hormonal contraception: proportion of boys 15.9% higher (95% confidence interval 6.5% to 25.3%), girls 20.4% (10.4% to 30.4%); intrauterine device used as emergency contraception: boys 4.2% (0.7% to 7.7%), girls 10.7% (0.4% to 21.0%). The number of pupils needed to be taught for one more pupil to know the correct time limits was six for boys and five for girls. The intervention and control groups did not differ in the proportion of pupils who were not virgins, in the proportion who had used emergency contraception, and in the proportion intending to use emergency contraception in the future. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention significantly improved the proportion of boys and girls knowing the correct time limits for both types of emergency contraception.

PATHS is a universal, teacher-taught social-emotional curriculum that is designed to improve children's social competence and reduce problem behavior. Twenty classrooms in two Pennsylvania communities participated in the study. Teachers in the 10 intervention classrooms implemented weekly lessons and extension activities across a 9-month period. Child assessments and teacher and parent reports of child behavior assessments were collected at the beginning and end of the school year. Analysis of covariance was used to control for baseline differences between the groups and pretest scores on each of the outcome measures. The results suggest that after exposure to PATHS, intervention children had higher emotion knowledge skills and were rated by parents and teachers as more socially competent compared to peers.

METHODS: A randomized trial of a 14-session face-to-face intervention emphasizing abstinence and safer sexual practices conducted among 515 youths (median age 17 years and median grade 11) attending 10 secondary schools located in two districts in Namibia. Youths were randomly assigned to the intervention or control condition at the level of the individual. HIV risk behaviours, intentions and perceptions were assessed at baseline, immediately post-intervention and at 6 and 12 months post-intervention. RESULTS: Among all 515 youths who enrolled in the programme, rates of either abstinence or sex with a condom were not different between control and intervention youths at baseline or in the follow-up period. However, analyses conducted among the subset of youths who were sexually inexperienced at baseline (n = 255) revealed that a higher percentage of intervention youths (17%) than control youths (9%, P<0.05) remained sexually inexperienced one year later. Moreover, in the immediate post-intervention period, among baseline virgins who subsequently initiated sex, intervention youths were more likely than control youths to use a condom (18 versus 10%, P<0.05). Additional HIV-related risk behaviours (failure to discuss previous HIV risk exposure with one's sexual partner and alcohol use), intentions to use condoms, and perceptions of the ability to use condoms were positively affected by the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence that the 'My Future is My Choice' (MFMC) intervention is reducing HIV risk behaviours among sexually inexperienced participants aged 15-18.

Methods: We designed a cognitive-behavioral school-based universal primary prevention program and followed 347 eighth-grade students participating in a randomized controlled trial for three months. Results: In line with our hypothesis, participants in the prevention program remained on a low level of depressive symptoms, having strong social networks. The control group showed increasing depressive symptoms and a reduced social network. Contrary to our expectations, students low in self-efficacy benefited more from the program than high self-efficient students.

METHODS: One hundred four children were randomly assigned to receive neurofeedback, CT, or a control condition and were evaluated 6 months postintervention. A 3-point growth model assessed change over time across the conditions on the Conners 3-Parent Assessment Report (Conners 3-P), the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function Parent Form (BRIEF), and a systematic double-blinded classroom observation (Behavioral Observation of Students in Schools). Analysis of variance assessed community-initiated changes in stimulant medication. RESULTS: Parent response rates were 90% at the 6-month follow-up. Six months postintervention, neurofeedback participants maintained significant gains on Conners 3-P (Inattention effect size [ES] = 0.34, Executive Functioning ES = 0.25, Hyperactivity/Impulsivity ES = 0.23) and BRIEF subscales including the Global Executive Composite (ES = 0.31), which remained significantly greater than gains found among children in CT and control conditions. Children in the CT condition showed delayed improvement over immediate postintervention ratings only on Conners 3-P Executive Functioning (ES = 0.18) and 2 BRIEF subscales. At the 6-month follow-up, neurofeedback participants maintained the same stimulant medication dosage, whereas participants in both CT and control conditions showed statistically and clinically significant increases (9 mg [P = .002] and 13 mg [P < .001], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Neurofeedback participants made more prompt and greater improvements in ADHD symptoms, which were sustained at the 6-month follow-up, than did CT participants or those in the control group. This finding suggests that neurofeedback is a promising attention training treatment for children with ADHD.

3030889,Rest of Europe,College/University,Professional Training,"BACKGROUND: Several studies have found a positive effect on the learning curve as well as the improvement of basic psychomotor skills in the operating room after virtual reality training. Despite this, the majority of surgical and gynecological departments encounter hurdles when implementing this form of training. This is mainly due to lack of knowledge concerning the time and human resources needed to train novice surgeons to an adequate level. The purpose of this trial is to investigate the impact of instructor feedback regarding time, repetitions and self-perception when training complex operational tasks on a virtual reality simulator. METHODS/DESIGN: The study population consists of medical students on their 4th to 6th year without prior laparoscopic experience. The study is conducted in a skills laboratory at a centralized university hospital. Based on a sample size estimation 98 participants will be randomized to an intervention group or a control group. Both groups have to achieve a predefined proficiency level when conducting a laparoscopic salpingectomy using a surgical virtual reality simulator. The intervention group receives standardized instructor feedback of 10 to 12 min a maximum of three times. The control group receives no instructor feedback. Both groups receive the automated feedback generated by the virtual reality simulator. The study follows the CONSORT Statement for randomized trials. Main outcome measures are time and repetitions to reach the predefined proficiency level on the simulator.

We measure the effect on learning outcomes of a prototypical interactive learning online statistics course by randomly assigning students on six public university campuses to take the course in a hybrid format (with machine?guided instruction accompanied by one hour of face?to?face instruction each week) or a traditional format (as it is usually offered by their campus, typically with about three hours of face?to?face instruction each week). We find that learning outcomes are essentially the sameï¿½that students in the hybrid format are not harmed by this mode of instruction in terms of pass rates, final exam scores, and performance on a standardized assessment of statistical literacy. We also conduct speculative cost simulations and find that adopting hybrid models of instruction in large introductory courses has the potential to significantly reduce instructor compensation costs in the long run.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: All 237 third-year students completing their 3-month surgery clerkships at 2 medical schools were asked to complete a urology online-education program covering 4 core topics of benign prostatic hyperplasia, erectile dysfunction, prostate cancer and screening with prostate specific antigen. Students were stratified by clinical site and randomized to 1 of 2 cohorts. Students in cohort A received interactive spaced education on prostate cancer/prostate specific antigen and web based teaching on benign prostatic hyperplasia/erectile dysfunction. Students in cohort B received interactive spaced education on benign prostatic hyperplasia/erectile dysfunction and web based teaching on prostate cancer/prostate specific antigen. A validated 28-item test on all 4 topics was administered at the end of the 10-week program. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences in end-of-program test scores were observed between cohorts in the topics of prostate cancer/prostate specific antigen with 87.6% (SD 12.9) for cohort A (interactive spaced education) and 82.4% (SD 19.6) for cohort B (web based teaching) (p = 0.25). Similarly there was also no statistically significant difference in test scores in the topics of benign prostatic hyperplasia/erectile dysfunction with 79.5% (SD 15.9) for cohort A (web based teaching) and 82.1% (SD 14.7) for cohort B (interactive spaced education, p = 0.28). When students were asked which format they would prefer if they were to receive all their urology online education in a single format, 55% of students (109 of 198 respondents) preferred interactive spaced education while 45% (89 of 109) preferred web based teaching (p = 0.16).

OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study is to investigate the efficacy and acceptability of a novel online educational methodology termed 'interactive spaced-education' (ISE) as a method to teach the physical examination. DESIGN: The design of the study is randomized controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: All 170 second-year students in the physical examination course at Harvard Medical School were eligible to enroll. MEASUREMENTS: Spaced-education items (questions and explanations) were developed on core physical examination topics and were content-validated by two experts. Based on pilot-test data, 36 items were selected for inclusion. Students were randomized to start the 18-week program in November 2006 or 12 weeks later. Students were sent 6 spaced-education e-mails each week for 6 weeks (cycle 1) which were then repeated in two subsequent 6-week cycles (cycles 2 and 3). Students submitted answers to the questions online and received immediate feedback. An online end-of-program survey was administered. RESULTS: One-hundred twenty students enrolled in the trial.

3031020,USA/Canada,College/University,Professional Training,"Background: Experienced colonoscopists reported that use of the water method for colonoscopy significantly increased adenoma detection rate (ADR) compared to traditional colonoscopy using only air insufflation. Whether trainees learning to perform colonoscopy can reproduce the observation is unknown. Aim: To compare the water method vs. usual air method in teaching novice trainee colonoscopy. This interim analysis is undertaken because trainees have reported anecdotally ease of learning colonoscopy with the water method. Confirmation by the interim data, even with all other outcome measures being comparable, may prompt other training programs to consider similar evaluations. Method: An IRB approved prospective randomized cross-over study (NCT01482546) in a university setting with diverse patient population. Design: Three first year GI fellows consented to participate in the study. Trainees were randomized to learn with either usual air method or the water method in performing colonoscopy with a dedicated endoscopy attending during their weekly outpatient endoscopy clinics for the initial six months of training and then cross-over to the other method for the remaining six months. The attending was familiar with the teaching technique and provided verbal instructions during the colonoscopy. Attending took over scope insertion if the trainee failed to advance the scope after 5 minutes or failed to get to the cecum in 20 minutes. The details of each procedure were documented by the nurse (e.g. medications, cecal intubation time, volume of water infused), the trainee (e.g. ease of learning colonoscopy, confidence) and the instructor (e.g. assessment of trainee competence). Procedure-related variables included ADR (primary outcome) and unassisted cecal intubation success rate. In recovery, a satisfaction survey was administered to the patient. Analysis was done by intention-to-treat. Results: The interim data (Table 1) revealed no significant difference in age, gender, and body mass index (BMI). ADR was significantly higher (p=0.035) and cecal intubation time was almost significantly lower (p=0.05) in the water method group. The unassisted cecal intubation rate (water 57.9% vs. air 42.1%, p=0.12), though in favor of the water method, did not reach statistical significance, likely because of the small sample size at this stage. Trainees rated the water method colonoscopy as significantly easier to learn compared to the air method (p=0.007). Conclusions: The interim data favor the water method with a significantly higher ADR and a shorter cecal intubation time that was nearly significant. The analysis also showed ease of learning colonoscopy with the water method by novice trainees.

3031450,Rest of Europe,Middle/High School,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"Background: Although school-based interventions to promote physical activity in adolescents have been suggested in several recent reviews, questions have been raised regarding the effects of the strategies and the methodology applied and for whom the interventions are effective. The aim of the present study was to investigate effects of a school-based intervention program: the HEalth in Adolescents (HEIA) study, on change in physical activity, and furthermore, to explore whether potential effects varied by gender, weight status, initial physical activity level and parental education level. Methods: This was a cluster randomized controlled 20 month intervention study which included 700 11-year-olds. Main outcome-variable was mean count per minute (cpm) derived from ActiGraph accelerometers (Model 7164/GT1M). Weight and height were measured objectively. Adolescents reported their pubertal status in a questionnaire and parents reported their education level on the consent form. Linear mixed models were used to test intervention effects and to account for the clustering effect of sampling by school. Results: The present study showed an intervention effect on overall physical activity at the level of p = 0.05 with a net effect of 50 cpm increase from baseline to post intervention in favour of the intervention group (95% CI &minus;0.4, 100). Subgroup analyses showed that the effect appeared to be more profound among girls (Est 65 cpm, CI 5, 124, p = 0.03) and among participants in the low-activity group (Est 92 cpm, CI 41, 142, p < 0.001), as compared to boys and participants in the high-activity group, respectively. Furthermore, the intervention affected physical activity among the normal weight group more positively than among the overweight, and participants with parents having 13ï¿½16 years of education more positively than participants with parents having either a lower or higher number of years of education. The intervention seemed to succeed in reducing time spent sedentary among girls but not among boys. Conclusions: A comprehensive but feasible, multi-component school-based intervention can affect physical activity patterns in adolescents by increasing overall physical activity. This intervention effect seemed to be more profound in girls than boys, low-active adolescents compared to high-active adolescents, participants with normal weight compared to the overweight, and for participants with parents of middle education level as opposed to those with high and low education levels, respectively. An implementation of the HEIA intervention components in the school system may have a beneficial effect on public health by increasing overall physical activity among adolescents and possibly among girls and low-active adolescents in particular.

3031917,UK/Ireland,Special School,Literacy/English,"Purpose: The authors aimed to establish whether 2 theoretically motivated interventions could improve use of verb argument structure in pupils with persistent specific language impairment (SLI). Method: Twenty-seven pupils with SLI (ages 11;0-16;1) participated in this randomized controlled trial with 'blind' assessment. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 therapy groups: syntactic-semantic, semantic, and control. All pupils received 9 weekly half-hour individual therapy sessions. They were assessed on a specifically designed video test pretherapy, posttherapy, and at follow-up. Results: Pupils receiving the syntactic-semantic and semantic therapies made significant progress (d greater than 1.0), which was maintained at follow-up and generalized to control verbs. Both therapies improved linking of arguments to syntax, and the syntactic-semantic therapy tended to increase use of optional arguments. Pupils receiving the control therapy made no progress. Conclusion: Both methods of argument structure therapy were effective. Comparisons of their effectiveness in specific areas led to the hypotheses that the pupils' initial difficulties with linking resulted from ill-defined semantic representations, whereas their limited use of arguments may have resulted from syntactic difficulties. When therapy is theoretically grounded, it can inform theories, be time limited, and be effective for older children with SLI.

3031616,USA/Canada,Preschool/Kindergarten,Behaviour and Social Wellbeing,"Background: Social and communication impairments are core deficits and prognostic indicators of autism. We evaluated the impact of supplementing a comprehensive intervention with a curriculum targeting socially synchronous behavior on social outcomes of toddlers with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Methods: Fifty toddlers with ASD, ages 21 to 33 months, were randomized to one of two six-month interventions: Interpersonal Synchrony or Non-Interpersonal Synchrony. The interventions provided identical intensity (10 hours per week in classroom), student-to-teacher ratio, schedule, home-based parent training (1.5 hours per month), parent education (38 hours), and instructional strategies, except the Interpersonal Synchrony condition provided a supplementary curriculum targeting socially engaged imitation, joint attention, and affect sharing; measures of these were primary outcomes. Assessments were conducted pre-intervention, immediately post-intervention, and, to assess maintenance, at six-month follow-up. Random effects models were used to examine differences between groups over time. Secondary analyses examined gains in expressive language and nonverbal cognition, and time effects during the intervention and follow-up periods. Results: A significant treatment effect was found for socially engaged imitation (p = 0.02), with more than doubling (17% to 42%) of imitated acts paired with eye contact in the Interpersonal Synchrony group after the intervention. This skill was generalized to unfamiliar contexts and maintained through follow-up. Similar gains were observed for initiation of joint attention and shared positive affect, but between-group differences did not reach statistical significance. A significant time effect was found for all outcomes (p less than 0.001); greatest change occurred during the intervention period, particularly in the Interpersonal Synchrony group. Conclusions: This is the first ASD randomized trial involving toddlers to identify an active ingredient for enhancing socially engaged imitation. Adding social engagement targets to intervention improves short-term outcome at no additional cost to the intervention. The social, language, and cognitive gains in our participants provide evidence for plasticity of these developmental systems in toddlers with ASD. http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00106210?term = landa&rank = 3.

3031200,Rest of Europe,Multiple,Study-Related Skills,"BACKGROUND: Deficits in executive functioning are of great significance in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). One of these executive functions, working memory, plays an important role in academic performance and is often seen as the core deficit of this disorder. There are indications that working memory problems and academic performance can be improved by school-oriented interventions but this has not yet been studied systematically. In this study we will determine the short- and long-term effects of a working memory--and an executive function training applied in a school situation for children with AD(H)D, taking individual characteristics, the level of impairment and costs (stepped-care approach) into account. METHODS/DESIGN: The study consists of two parts: the first part is a randomised controlled trial with school-aged children (8-12 yrs) with AD(H)D. Two groups (each n = 50) will be randomly assigned to a well studied computerized working memory training 'Cogmed', or to the 'Paying attention in class' intervention which is an experimental school-based executive function training. Children will be selected from regular -and special education primary schools in the region of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The second part of the study will determine which specific characteristics are related to non-response of the 'Paying attention in class' intervention. School-aged children (8-12 yrs) with AD(H)D will follow the experimental school-based executive function training 'Paying attention in class' (n = 175). Academic performance and neurocognitive functioning (primary outcomes) are assessed before, directly after and 6 months after training. Secondary outcome measures are: behaviour in class, behaviour problems and quality of life. DISCUSSION: So far, there is limited but promising evidence that working memory - and other executive function interventions can improve academic performance. Little is know about the applicability and generalization effects of these interventions in a classroom situation. This study will contribute to this lack of information, especially information related to real classroom and academic situations. By taking into account the costs of both interventions, level of impairment and individual characteristics of the child (stepped-care approach) we will be able to address treatment more adequately for each individual in the future.

3031324,USA/Canada,Middle/High School,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"Purpose: This paper presents results from a randomized controlled trial that assessed the short- and longer-term impact of a skills-based HIV/STI/pregnancy prevention curriculum, service learning, and the combination. Methods: The study featured a four-arm experimental design involving 47 classrooms (765 youth) from continuation high schools. Classrooms were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: (1) HIV/STI/pregnancy prevention curriculum only; (2) service learning only; (3) HIV/STI/pregnancy prevention curriculum plus service learning; or (4) an attention control curriculum. Students completed 3 surveys over 18 months. Multi-level analysis was used to adjust for the correlation among students within the same classroom and school, and the correlation of repeated measurements. Results: Participants were 53% male (mean age: 16.2 years). The majority of youth reported being Hispanic/Latino or African-American (37.9% and 22.3%, respectively). Students in the HIV/STI/pregnancy prevention curriculum condition were less likely to have vaginal intercourse without a condom in the 3 months prior to the survey [odds ratio (OR) =.58, p =.04]; these effects diminished by final follow-up. The program also significantly reduced students' exposure to risky situations. These changes were not significant in the service learning only or combined intervention conditions relative to control. Conclusion: This study is one of a few controlled studies of HIV/STI and pregnancy prevention programs in continuation settings, and suggests the curriculum was effective in changing selected risk behaviors in the short term. 2013 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

The preschoolers were randomly assigned to experimental or waitlist control groups. The parents in the experimental group received 12 sessions of school-based training on paired reading in 7 weeks. They were required to do paired reading with their children for at least four times in each of these 7 weeks. At the end of the program, the preschoolers in the experimental group had better performance in word recognition and reading fluency than their counterparts in the control group. They were also reported as more competent and motivated in reading by their parents. More importantly, the program had many favorable effects on parents. Parents in the experimental group had higher self-efficacy in helping their children to be better readers and learners. They also reported that they had better relationships with their children. Their changes in relationships and self-efficacy were found to mediate the program impact on some of the child outcomes. However, family income did not moderate the effectiveness of the program.

3031277,UK/Ireland,Middle/High School,Literacy/English,"Background: Computer software is widely used to support literacy learning. There are few randomised trials to support its effectiveness. Therefore, there is an urgent need to rigorously evaluate computer software that supports literacy learning. Methods: We undertook a pragmatic randomised controlled trial among pupils aged 11-12 within a single state comprehensive school in the North of England. The pupils were randomised to receive 10 hours of literacy learning delivered via laptop computers or to act as controls. Both groups received normal literacy learning. A pre-test and two post-tests were given in spelling and literacy. The main pre-defined outcome was improvements in spelling scores. Results: 155 pupils were randomly allocated, 77 to the ICT group and 78 to control. Four pupils left the school before post-testing and 25 pupils did not have both pre- and post-test data. Therefore, 63 and 67 pupils were included in the main analysis for the ICT and control groups respectively. After adjusting for pre-test scores there was a slight increase in spelling scores, associated with the ICT intervention, but this was not statistically significant (0.954, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.83 to 3.74, p = 0.50). For reading scores there was a statistically significant decrease associated with the ICT intervention (-2.33, 95% CI -0.96 to -3.71, p = 0.001). Conclusions: We found no evidence of a statistically significant benefit on spelling outcomes using a computer program for literacy learning. For reading there seemed to be a reduction in reading scores associated with the use of the program.

While STAR led to large test score benefits during the intervention, these benefits quickly faded at its conclusion. However, research has recently shown that the STAR experiment led to long term benefits, including increases in college entrance exams participation (ACT/SAT), especially for minority students. We collect new follow up data on high school participation in extracurricular activities to examine whether (1) STAR increased participation in high school activities and (2) whether this increase in participation in high school is the explanation behind the long term benefits of the intervention. We find suggestive evidence that STAR did indeed increase some aspects of high school participation, including scholastic honors and participation in sports, especially for minority students. In contrast, we find little evidence that this increase in participation is the mechanism that has conferred higher rates of college-going to the STAR students.

METHODS: Eighteen high schools were randomly assigned to one of two prevention programs: one led by teachers and the other by peer leaders. A sample of students attending the last 2 years (n = 1295) completed pre and post-intervention questionnaires. Changes in sexual behaviors, knowledge, prevention skills, risk perception and attitudes were first evaluated within each intervention group. Afterwards, changes in knowledge, prevention skills, risk perception, and attitudes total scale scores (post-test scores minus pre-test scores) were compared between the two groups, through linear regression models, in order to control for confounders, taking into account the within-school correlation in score changes. As for sexual behaviors, number of sexual partners and frequency of condom use in the 3 months before post-test were compared by intervention group through ordinal regression models, also taking into account behaviors reported before pre-test. RESULTS: For both groups, we observed significant improvements in skills, knowledge, attitudes and risk perception. The peer-led group showed a 6.7% (95% C.I. 1.9-11.5) scores greater improvement in knowledge, compared to the teacher-led group. In neither group were improvements observed in condom use or number of sexual partners.

Since, at that age, game appears to be an appropriate tool to teach nutrition knowledge and to influence dietary behaviour, the new educational board-game Kaledo was tested for promoting a healthy diet and lifestyle in children. Methods: A two group design (treatment and control) with 1 pre-intervention assessment and 2 post-intervention assessments after 6 and 18 months was used. School was the unit of recruitment and random assignment to groups. During a 20 weeks period, once a week, a group of 1076 students (10 schools) participated to 1530 minute-long play sessions with Kaledo. The control group (1081 students from 9 schools) did not participate in any play session with Kaledo. Changes in diet and physical activity were evaluated through validated questionnaires (Turconi et al. 2003; Johnson et al. 2002) collected at the 3 assessment times. At the same time, anthropometric measurements were performed in order to evaluate changes in the body mass index of the participants. Results: In the two post-intervention assessments, the treated group obtained significant better scores than the control in the questionnaire sections labelled 'Nutrition Knowledge', 'Healthy and Unhealthy Diet and Food', 'Food Habits Checklist', 'Physical Activity and Lifestyle' and 'Food Habits'.

3031780,Rest of Europe,College/University,Professional Training,"PURPOSE: To assess the use of peer-assisted learning (PAL) of complex manipulative motor skills with respect to gender in medical students. METHODS: In 2007-2010, 292 students in their 3rd and 4th years of medical school were randomly assigned to two groups [Staff group (SG), PAL group (PG)] led by either staff tutors or student-teachers (ST). The students were taught bimanual practical and diagnostic skills (course education module of eight separate lessons) as well as a general introduction to the theory of spinal manipulative therapy. In addition to qualitative data collection (Likert scale), evaluation was performed using a multiple-choice questionnaire in addition to an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE). RESULTS: Complex motor skills as well as palpatory diagnostic competencies could in fact be better taught through professionals than through ST (manipulative OSCE grades/diagnostic OSCE score; SG vs. PG; male: P = 0.017/P < 0.001, female: P < 0.001/P < 0.001). The registration of theoretical knowledge showed equal results in students taught by staff or ST. In both teaching groups (SG: n = 147, PG: n = 145), no significant differences were observed between male and female students in matters of manipulative skills or theoretical knowledge. Diagnostic competencies were better in females than in males in the staff group (P = 0.041) Overall, students were more satisfied with the environment provided by professional teachers than by ST, though male students regarded the PAL system more suspiciously than their female counterparts.

Design: Randomized controlled trial. Setting: King's College, London. Methods: 41 medical students were included in the study. After randomization, they were divided into 5 groups. Group 1 was the control group without training; group 2 was box trained; group 3 was also box trained with an additional practice session; group 4 was VRS trained; and group 5 was solely mentally trained. The task was to cut out a circle marked on a stretchable material. All groups were assessed after 1 week on both BT and VRS. Four main parameters were assessed, namely time, precision, accuracy, and performance. Results: Time: On BT assessment, the box-trained group with additional practice group 3 was the fastest, and the mental-trained group 5 was the slowest. On VRS assessment, the time difference between group 3 and the control group 1 was statistically significant. Precision: On BT assessment, the box-trained groups 2 and 3 scored high, and mental trained were low on precision. On VRS assessment, the VRS-trained group ranked at the top, and the MT group was at the bottom on precision. Accuracy: On BT assessment, the box-trained group 3 was best and the mental-trained group was last. On VRS assessment, the VRS-trained group 4 scored high closely followed by box-trained groups 2 and 3. Performance: On BT assessment, the box-trained group 3 ranked above all the other groups, and the mental-trained group ranked last. On VRS assessment, the VRS group 4 scored best, followed closely by box-trained groups 2 and 3. Conclusions: The skills learned on box training were reproducible on both VRS and BT. However, not all the skills learned on VRS were transferable to BT. Furthermore, VRS was found to be a reliable and the most convenient method of assessment.

Aim: To investigate whether learning basic life support (BLS) and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) from video produce higher learning outcomes compared to pictures in reciprocal learning. Methods: A randomized controlled trial. A total of 128 students (mean age: 17 years) constituting eight intact classes from a secondary school learned BLS in reciprocal roles of doer and helper with tablet PCs. Student pairs in each class were randomized over a Picture and a Video group. In the Picture group, students learned BLS by means of pictures combined with written instructions. In the Video group, BLS was learned through videos with on-screen instructions. Informational equivalence was assured since instructions in both groups comprised exactly the same words. BLS assessment occurred unannounced, three weeks following intervention. Results: Analysis of variance demonstrated no significant differences in chest compression depths between the Picture group (M= 42. mm, 95% CI. = 40-45) and the Video group (M= 39. mm, 95% CI. = 36-42).

The demonstration's focus is on determining whether Learning Communities are an effective strategy for helping students who have been referred to developmental education. The setting of this research is Hillsborough Community College, Queensborough Community College and Houston Community College. Findings from these three Learning Communities Demonstration sites are as follows: (1) Hillsborough's fairly basic Learning Communities' model did not have a meaningful impact on students' academic success (in terms of likelihood of completing developmental reading, average total credits attempted/earned, and rates of persistence); (2) Both Houston's and Queensborough's Learning Communities programs showed evidence of helping students progress through the developmental math sequence more quickly; and (3) Houston's and Queensborough's Learning Communities programs both did not show evidence of lasting impacts on credit accumulation or retention.

There are limited data regarding the learning curve for trainees for using pCLE in diagnosing BE associated neoplasia. Aim: To determine the learning curve of medical trainees in diagnosing BE associated neoplasia using pCLE. Methods: Videos from a previously conducted multicenter trial evaluating the utility of pCLE in BE were used for this study. Study participants (GI fellows and medical students) with no previous pCLE experience were randomized to either in-class didactic or selfdirected teaching groups stratified by level of training. A standardized power point presentation was developed explaining the technology, the disease state and using previously published validated criteria for diagnosing dysplasia in BE: 1)epithelial surface: saw-toothed 2)goblet cells: sparse 3)glands: not equidistant 4)glands: unequal in size and shape 5)cells: enlarged 6)cells: pleomorphic. For in-class didactic group, an expert in pCLE conducted a classroom teaching session with an opportunity for interaction. Every study participant in the self-directed teaching group was provided with the same teaching power point but with recorded audio explaining the pCLE features to distinguish dysplastic and non-dysplastic BE. Following this initial training, all participants completed 1st set of 20 pCLE videos (pre-feedback) after which they reviewed correct responses with either the expert (in-class didactic group) or on audio power point (self teaching group). Finally, all participants completed next set of 40 videos (post-feedback) and marked their level of confidence in video interpretation for all assessments. Fisher's exact test was used to calculate statistical differences between groups. Results:60 pCLE videos (nondysplastic BE 40 and dysplastic 20) were assessed by 18 study participants (10 GI fellows and 8 students). The overall accuracy of the entire group significantly improved from 73% to 79% post feedback (p=0.04) (Table). This improvement was driven by overall improvement post feedback for the in-class didactic group (from 74% to 84%; p<0.01). Students had improvement in the proportion of predictions with high confidence (from 47% to 54.4% p 0.1) while fellows improved their pCLE accuracy in high-confidence predictions (from 82% to 91%, p 0.02) (Table). Finally, accuracy improved with years in endoscopy training (72.08% Students, 77.08% FY1, 82% FY2 and 85% FY3, p 0.003). Conclusions: Trainees taught by an in-class, didactic teaching session (overall 1 hour) had a shorter learning curve and achieved higher accuracies compared to self-directed learning group for the use of pCLE to diagnose BE associated neoplasia. In-class didactic teaching sessions should be the preferred method to teach pCLE for use in BE.

The current study investigates the effectiveness of a workshop designed to foster learning goals for emotion regulation. Fifty participating college students (ages 18 to 21) were randomly assigned to either an intervention or a waitlist control condition and completed measures at baseline and post-test (approximately four weeks later). The intervention consisted of a three-session workshop in which participants explored hands-on activity stations, each based on an area of current research in emotion regulation. The intervention applied principles from goal orientation theory to promote learning goals, including focusing on personally meaningful tasks, engaging participants in making choices, and providing recognition for experimenting and practice rather than judging results. Outcome variables included emotion regulation strategies, emotion regulation competence beliefs, physiological and experiential responses to an emotional induction, depressive symptoms, and college grades. The results of this randomized control trial indicated that relative to control participants, intervention participants showed increased use of new emotion regulation strategies and greater reflection on emotions at post-test. The findings are discussed in light of related research suggesting that, in addition to promoting constructive strategies, it may also be important to address individuals' goals for managing their emotions.

3031110,USA/Canada,College/University,Professional Training,"There is increased pressure in universities and in the business community to use online methods for adult education. Historically asynchronous technologies have dominated distance education programs. Asynchronous technologies allow the learner any time access to learning activities. Technology has now progressed and synchronous or real-time interactive technologies such as webinars are proliferating. Despite increasing use, research on educational effectiveness is lacking in published research. If evidence is to guide educational practice research of sufficient rigor is required. A two-group experimental posttest only study was therefore conducted to compare the differential effect of a 30 minute learning module delivered by webinar versus classroom instruction to 224 randomly assigned baccalaureate nursing students. The independent variable was the teaching modality (i.e., webinar versus classroom) and the dependent variable was learning outcomes as measured by the score achieved on an online proctored 30 minute posttest administered immediately after the teaching modality. The posttest was a custom exam developed by Elsevier HESI&reg; Testing, a company experienced in the development of test items based on the NCLEX-RN&reg; blueprint. The andragogy in practice model and Bloom's revised taxonomy formed the conceptual framework for the study. Webinar participants received the learning module in a classroom via an individual computer and audio/voice headset and classroom participants in a regular classroom without computers. The learning module was taught on the same day by the researcher using the same PowerPoint lecture, with 5 minutes between the groups to minimize opportunities for exchange of information. Study protocols were carefully followed to ensure both groups received equal attention. The researcher hypothesized that participants randomly assigned to the webinar group would score higher on the posttest than classroom participants. A significant Levene's test of homogeneity prompted the use of the Welch's t -test. Based on an alpha of .05 and a one-tailed test, the research hypothesis was not supported.

3031472,Rest of Europe,Primary/Elementary,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"Background: School-based intervention studies promoting a healthy lifestyle have shown favorable immediate health effects. However, there is a striking paucity on long-term follow-ups. The aim of this study was therefore to assess the 3 yr-follow- up of a cluster-randomized controlled school-based physical activity program over nine month with beneficial immediate effects on body fat, aerobic fitness and physical activity. Methods and Findings: Initially, 28 classes from 15 elementary schools in Switzerland were grouped into an intervention (16 classes from 9 schools, n = 297 children) and a control arm (12 classes from 6 schools, n = 205 children) after stratification for grade (1st and 5th graders). Three years after the end of the multi-component physical activity program of nine months including daily physical education (i.e. two additional lessons per week on top of three regular lessons), short physical activity breaks during academic lessons, and daily physical activity homework, 289 (58%) participated in the follow-up. Primary outcome measures included body fat (sum of four skinfolds), aerobic fitness (shuttle run test), physical activity (accelerometry), and quality of life (questionnaires). After adjustment for grade, gender, baseline value and clustering within classes, children in the intervention arm compared with controls had a significantly higher average level of aerobic fitness at follow-up (0.373 z-score units [95%-CI: 0.157 to 0.59, p = 0.001] corresponding to a shift from the 50th to the 65th percentile between baseline and follow-up), while the immediate beneficial effects on the other primary outcomes were not sustained. Conclusions: Apart from aerobic fitness, beneficial effects seen after one year were not maintained when the intervention was stopped. A continuous intervention seems necessary to maintain overall beneficial health effects as reached at the end of the intervention.

We took advantage of a previous randomised comparison between PBL and traditional teaching in a 3rd year course to follow up factual knowledge of the students during their 4th and 5th year of medical school training. METHODS: 3rd year medical students were initially randomized to participate in a problem-based (PBL, n = 55), or a lecture-based (LBL, n = 57) course in basic pharmacology. Summative exam results were monitored 18 months later (after finishing a lecture-based course in clinical pharmacology). Additional results of an unscheduled, formative exam were obtained 27 months after completion of the first course. RESULTS: Of the initial sample of 112 students, 90 participated in the second course and exam (n = 45, 45). 32 (n = 17 PBL, n = 15 LBL) could be exposed to the third, formative exam.

Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate a school intervention program to promote lifestyle changes and to prevent obesity among third and fourth grade children through changes in lifestyle at schools and home. Methods: This was a cluster randomized controlled trial conducted in four elementary schools in Tijuana during 18 months. Two public and two private schools were randomly selected. Weight, height and waist circumference (cc) was assessed. The program included activities addressed to children, parents, teachers and school administrators, all of whom were advised to change their consumption of high energy foods, fruits and vegetables, physical activity (PA), the availability of foods and menus at the school's cafeteria and at home. Results: The children's mean age was 8.4 years. At the end of the study no differences were observed in BMI. At six months, the prevalence of overweight and obesity in the intervention group showed an 8.9% remission and 1.2% in the control group. At the end of the study an increase in vegetables intake was observed (P = 0.007), which was associated to the increase in the availability of vegetables at home (P = 0.0001).

Design: The study used a 1-year group-randomized controlled trial. Setting: The study took place in ASPs operating in South Carolina, United States. Subjects: Twenty ASPs serving over 1700 children were recruited, match-paired postbaseline on enrollment size and days fruits/vegetables were served per week, and randomized to either intervention (n = 10) or control (n = 10) groups. Intervention: The study used Strategies To Enhance Practice for Healthy Eating (STEPs-HE), a multistep adaptive intervention framework that assists ASP leaders and staff to serve snacks that meet nutrition policies while maintaining cost. Measures: Direct observation of snacks served and consumed and monthly snack expenditures as determined by receipts were used. Analysis: The study used nonparametric and mixed-model repeated measures. Results. By postassessment, intervention ASPs increased serving of fruits/vegetables to 3.9 &plusmn; 2.1 vs. 0.7 &plusmn; 1.7 d/wk and decreased serving sugar-sweetened beverages to 0.1 &plusmn; 0.7 vs. 1.8 &plusmn; 2.4 d/wk and sugar-sweetened foods to 0.3 &plusmn; 1.1 vs. 2.7 &plusmn; 2.5 d/wk compared to controls, respectively.

3030697,Rest of Europe,College/University,Professional Training,"OBJECTIVES: Basic life support (BLS) by doctors has been shown to be of poor quality. To improve medical education training should be simplified, and simultaneously the learner should be involved more actively. To combine both ideas we trained medical students to give BLS courses and sent them to teach school children. This was a requirement for their emergency medicine course. Our model was compared to conventional teaching. DESIGN: Medical students were assigned at random to one of three groups. Group 1 ('university') attended a conventional university BLS/ALS course. Group 2 ('EMS') accompanied a BLS vehicle of the emergency medical service (EMS) after suitable preparation. Group 3 ('school') was instructed to teach BLS and then sent to teach at schools. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinically significant BLS skills, and overall BLS skills, each assessed by structured clinical examination (SCE). Theoretical knowledge assessed by written (open question) test. RESULTS: Clinically relevant mistakes were seen in 37.5% in group 1 ('university'), compared to 28.8% in group 2 ('EMS'), and 11.3% in group 3 ('school'). Highly significant differences were shown between 'school' and 'EMS' (p=0.011), and between 'school' and 'university' (p<0.001). In practical testing for overall performance the 'university' group reached a median of 78.8% (25th-75th percentile 69.2-84.6%), group 'EMS' reached 76.9% (69.2-88.5%), and group 'school' 84.6% (76.9-90.0). Group 'school' showed significant advantages over 'university' (p=0.015) and 'EMS' (p=0.010). Written test results did not differ statistically. CONCLUSION: Medical students teaching BLS to school children as a compulsory element of their own medical training showed superior practical skills as compared to conventional teaching.

3031519,Australia/New Zealand,Middle/High School,Behaviour and Social Wellbeing,"Background: Prevention of the onset of depression in adolescence may prevent social dysfunction, teenage pregnancy, substance abuse, suicide, and mental health conditions in adulthood. New technologies allow delivery of prevention programs scalable to large and disparate populations. Objective: To develop and test the novel mobile phone delivery of a depression prevention intervention for adolescents. We describe the development of the intervention and the results of participantsï¿½ self-reported satisfaction with the intervention. Methods: The intervention was developed from 15 key messages derived from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). The program was fully automated and delivered in 2 mobile phone messages/day for 9 weeks, with a mixture of text, video, and cartoon messages and a mobile website. Delivery modalities were guided by social cognitive theory and marketing principles. The intervention was compared with an attention control program of the same number and types of messages on different topics. A double-blind randomized controlled trial was undertaken in high schools in Auckland, New Zealand, from June 2009 to April 2011. Results: A total of 1348 students (13ï¿½17 years of age) volunteered to participate at group sessions in schools, and 855 were eventually randomly assigned to groups. Of these, 835 (97.7%) self-completed follow-up questionnaires at postprogram interviews on satisfaction, perceived usefulness, and adherence to the intervention. Over three-quarters of participants viewed at least half of the messages and 90.7% (379/418) in the intervention group reported they would refer the program to a friend. Intervention group participants said the intervention helped them to be more positive (279/418, 66.7%) and to get rid of negative thoughts (210/418, 50.2%)ï¿½significantly higher than proportions in the control group. Conclusions: Key messages from CBT can be delivered by mobile phone, and young people report that these are helpful. Change in clinician-rated depression symptom scores from baseline to 12 months, yet to be completed, will provide evidence on the effectiveness of the intervention. If proven effective, this form of delivery may be useful in many countries lacking widespread mental health services but with extensive mobile phone coverage.

Recent psychological and technological advances suggest that active learning may enhance understanding and retention of statistical principles. A randomized trial was designed to evaluate the addition of innovative instructional methods within didactic biostatistics courses for public health professionals. Aims . The primary objectives were to evaluate and compare the addition of two active learning methods (cooperative and internet) on students' performance; assess their impact on performance after adjusting for differences in students' learning style; and examine the influence of learning style on trial participation. Methods . Consenting students enrolled in a graduate introductory biostatistics course were randomized to cooperative learning, internet learning, or control after completing a pretest survey. The cooperative learning group participated in eight small group active learning sessions on key statistical concepts, while the internet learning group accessed interactive mini-applications on the same concepts. Controls received no intervention. Students completed evaluations after each session and a post-test survey. Study outcome was performance quantified by examination scores. Intervention effects were analyzed by generalized linear models using intent-to-treat analysis and marginal structural models accounting for reported participation. Results . Of 376 enrolled students, 265 (70%) consented to randomization; 69, 100, and 96 students were randomized to the cooperative, internet, and control groups, respectively. Intent-to-treat analysis showed no differences between study groups; however, 51% of students in the intervention groups had dropped out after the second session. After accounting for reported participation, expected examination scores were 2.6 points higher (of 100 points) after completing one cooperative learning session (95% CI: 0.3, 4.9) and 2.4 points higher after one internet learning session (95% CI: 0.0, 4.7), versus nonparticipants or controls, adjusting for other performance predictors. Students who preferred learning by reflective observation and active experimentation experienced improved performance through internet learning (5.9 points, 95% CI: 1.2, 10.6) and cooperative learning (2.9 points, 95% CI: 0.6, 5.2), respectively.

3031639,Rest of Europe,Middle/High School,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"BACKGROUND: There is limited knowledge as to whether obesity prevention interventions are able to produce change in the determinants hypothesized to precede change in energy balance-related behaviors in young people. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a multi-component intervention on a wide range of theoretically informed determinants of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB). Moderation effects of gender, weight status and parental education level and whether the perceived intervention dose received influenced the effects were also explored. METHODS: The HEIA study was a 20-month school-based, randomized controlled trial to promote healthy weight development. In total, 1418 11-year-olds participated at baseline and post-intervention assessment. Enjoyment, self-efficacy, perceived social support from parents, teachers and friends related to PA, perceived parental regulation of TV-viewing and computer/game-use and perceived social inclusion at schools were examined by covariance analyses to assess overall effects and moderation by gender, weight status and parental education, mid-way and post-intervention. Covariance analyses were also used to examine the role of intervention dose received on change in the determinants. RESULTS: At mid-way enjoyment (p?=?.03), perceived social support from teachers (p?=?.003) and self-efficacy (p?=?.05) were higher in the intervention group. Weight status moderated the effect on self-efficacy, with a positive effect observed among the normal weight only. At post-intervention results were sustained for social support from teachers (p?=?.001), while a negative effect was found for self-efficacy (p?=?.02). Weight status moderated the effect on enjoyment, with reduced enjoyment observed among the overweight. Moderation effects for parental education level were detected for perceived social support from parents and teachers. Finally, positive effects on several determinants were observed among those receiving a high as opposed to a low intervention dose. CONCLUSION: The intervention affected both psychological and social-environmental determinants. Results indicate that social support from teachers might be a potential mediator of PA change, and that overweight adolescents might be in need of specially targeted interventions to avoid reducing their enjoyment of PA. Further studies should continue to assess how intervention effectiveness is influenced by the participants' self-reported dose of intervention received.","Mid-way and post-intervention effects on potential determinants of physical activity and sedentary behavior, results of the HEIA study - a multi-component school-based randomized trial","https://www.google.com/search?q=Mid-way+and+post-intervention+effects+on+potential+determinants+of+physical+activity+and+sedentary+behavior,+results+of+the+HEIA+study+-+a+multi-component+school-based+randomized+trial",2012,Universal,Regular Teachers/Lecturers,Full Academic Year or Longer,None,None,Clustered,1418,37,Yes,Some Sub-Groups Reported,Immediate Post-Test Only,Yes,No,"Yes, Theoretical Perspectives",Yes,Rest of Europe Middle/High School Physical Health and Wellbeing

Already in the course of university studies, medicine and psychology students report mental distress and low life satisfaction. There is a need for interventions that promote better coping skills in students in order to prevent distress and future burnout. This study examines the effect of a seven-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) programme on mental distress, study stress, burnout, subjective well-being, and mindfulness of medical and psychology students. A total of 288 students (mean age = 23 years, 76% female) from the University of Oslo and the University of Tromso were randomly allocated to an intervention or control group. The control group continued with their standard university courses and received no intervention. Participants were evaluated using self-reported measures both before and after the intervention. These were: the 'General Health Questionnaire, Maslach Burnout Inventory Student version, Perceived Medical School Stress, Subjective Well-being, and Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire' and additional indices of compliance. Following the intervention, a moderate effect on mental distress (Hedges'g 0.65, CI = .41, .88), and a small effect on both subjective well-being (Hedges'g 0.40, CI = .27, .63) and the mindfulness facet 'non-reacting' (Hedges'g 0.33, CI = .10, .56) were found in the intervention group compared with the control group. A higher level of programme attendance and reported mindfulness exercises predicted these changes. Significant effects were only found for female students who additionally reported reduced study stress and an increase in the mindfulness facet 'non-judging'. Gender specific effects of participation in the MBSR programme have not previously been reported, and gender differences in the present study are discussed. Female medical and psychology students experienced significant positive improvements in mental distress, study stress, subjective well-being and mindfulness after participating in the MBSR programme.

Two hundred and twenty nine socially disadvantaged children recruited at the start of first and second grade at risk of reading failure participated in the randomized controlled trial study over an 18-month period. The results from structural equation modeling show the combined instructional and emotional support was a proximal outcome, whose distal outcomes included gains in reading achievement. There was no evidence that either academic self-beliefs or frequency of reading at home mediated program impact on reading achievement. In addition, academic self-beliefs became more accurate and stable as children advanced through school. Reading achievement mediated the impact of earlier reading achievement on both academic self-beliefs and frequency of reading at home for children entering second and third grade. In contrast, for the youngest children (at the start of first grade), academic self-beliefs were negatively associated with subsequent academic self-beliefs and frequency of reading at home.","Modeling the Interaction of Academic Self-Beliefs, Frequency of Reading at Home, Emotional Support, and Reading Achievement: An RCT Study of At-Risk Early Readers in First Grade and Second Grade","https://www.google.com/search?q=Modeling+the+Interaction+of+Academic+Self-Beliefs,+Frequency+of+Reading+at+Home,+Emotional+Support,+and+Reading+Achievement:+An+RCT+Study+of+At-Risk+Early+Readers+in+First+Grade+and+Second+Grade",2016,Targeted,Other School/College Employees,Full Academic Year or Longer,Range of Academic Outcomes,None,Single,229,NA,Yes,Some Sub-Groups Reported,Immediate Post-Test Only,No,No,"Yes, Theoretical Perspectives",Yes,UK/Ireland Primary/Elementary Literacy/English

Schools within each area were randomly assigned to either intervention or nonintervention groups. In schools targeted for intervention, children in the fourth through eighth grades were taught a teacher-delivered curriculum focusing on diet, physical activity, and cigarette smoking. Risk-factor levels were measured in all schools at base line and at four follow-up points. A total of 1769 of the children qualified for analysis of the intervention effect. After five years, the net mean change in plasma levels of total cholesterol was -1.7 mg per deciliter per year (-0.04 mmol per liter) (95 percent confidence interval, -2.7 to -0.7 mg per deciliter [-0.07 to -0.02 mmol per liter]) in the Westchester County schools, or -8.5 mg per deciliter (-0.22 mmol per liter) (5.1 percent) over a period of five years.

3031498,NA,NA,NA,"Delayed sleep timing is a common issue among adolescents. The school classroom has been considered by many to be a promising arena for the dissemination of sleep education to assist adolescents, particularly those with delayed sleep timing, to improve their sleep habits. However, previous research suggests that improvements in sleep knowledge may not translate into actual behaviour change. The likely influence of low intrinsic motivation led to the development of a Sleep Education Program (SEP) based on principles of Motivational Interviewing. The current study aimed to further evaluate and extend this program in a randomised controlled trial, with the addition of bright light therapy (BLT; using 'Re-Timers' portable green light LED glasses) and parental involvement (PI; via weekly brief YouTube videos for parents). Participants were 193 adolescents (age = 16.3 +/- 0.4 yrs, 79%f) from 6 schools. Three intervention groups (i.e., SEP + BLT, SEP + PI, SEP + BLT + PI) were compared to a control group who attended classes-as-usual (with no sleep information).

Volume I see ED499017] contains key findings on the implementation of the program under No Child Left Behind, and Volume II presents a report on follow-up findings from Closing the Reading Gap, an evaluation of the impact of supplemental remedial reading programs on achievement of 3rd and 5th grade students. According to the National Assessment of Educational Progress (U.S. Department of Education 2006), 36 percent of fourth graders read below the basic level. Such literacy problems can worsen as students advance through school and are exposed to progressively more complex concepts and courses. The nation's 16,000 school districts are spending hundreds of millions of dollars on educational products and services developed by textbook publishers, commercial providers, and nonprofit organizations, yet little is known about the effectiveness of these interventions. To help shed light on their effectiveness, the authors of the present volume initiated an evaluation of either parts or all of four widely used programs for elementary school students with reading problems. The programs are Corrective Reading, Failure Free Reading, Spell Read P.A.T., and Wilson Reading, all of which would be more intensive and skillfully delivered than the programs typically provided in public schools. The programs incorporate explicit and systematic instruction in the basic reading skills in which struggling readers are frequently deficient. This study is a large-scale, longitudinal evaluation comprising two main elements. The first element of the evaluation is an impact study designed to determine: (1) the impact of being in any of the four remedial reading interventions, considered as a group, relative to the instruction provided by the schools; (2) whether the impacts of the interventions vary across students with different baseline characteristics; and (3) the extent that the instruction provided in this study close the reading gap and bring struggling readers within the normal range, relative to the instruction provided by their schools. The second element of the evaluation is an implementation study that has two components: (1) an exploration of the similarities and differences in reading instruction offered in the four interventions; and (2) a description of the regular instruction that students in the control group received in the absence of the interventions, and of the regular instruction received by the treatment group beyond the interventions. The evaluation found that the interventions: improved some reading skills; did not improve Pennsylvania System of School Assessment (PSSA) scores; narrowed some reading gaps; and helped third-graders more than fifth graders, although the interventions did not consistently benefit any one subgroup more than another.

3030869,USA/Canada,Primary/Elementary,Literacy/English,"According to the National Assessment of Educational Progress, nearly 4 in 10 fourth graders read below the basic level. These literacy problems get worse as students advance through school and are exposed to progressively more complex concepts and courses. The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of four remedial reading programs in improving the reading skills of 3rd and 5th graders, whether the impacts of the programs vary across students with difference baseline characteristics, and to what extent can this instruction close the reading gap and bring struggling readers within the normal range--relative to the instruction normally provided by their schools. The study took place in elementary schools in 27 districts of the Allegheny Intermediate Unit outside Pittsburgh, PA during the 2003-04 school year. Within each of 50 schools, 3rd and 5th grade students were identified as struggling readers by their teachers. These students were tested and were eligible for the study if they scored at or below the 30th percentile on a word-level reading test and at or above the 5th percentile on a vocabulary test. The final sample contains a total of 742 students. There are 335 3rd graders ? 208 treatment and 127 control students. There are 407 5th graders ? 228 treatment and 179 control students. Four existing programs were used: Spell Read P.A.T., Corrective Reading, Wilson Reading, and Failure Free Reading. Corrective Reading and Wilson Reading were modified to focus only on word-level skills. Spell Read P.A.T. and Failure Free Reading were intended to focus equally on word-level skills and reading comprehension/vocabulary. Teachers received 70 hours of professional development and support during the year. Instruction was delivered in small groups of 3 students, 5 days a week, for a total of 90 hours. Seven measures of reading skill were administered at the beginning and end of the school year to assess student progress: Word Attack, Word Identification Comprehension (Woodcock Reading Mastery Test); Phonemic Decoding Efficiency and Sight Word Efficiency (Test of Word Reading Efficiency); Oral Reading Fluency (Edformation); and Passage Comprehension (Group Reading Assessment and Diagnostic Evaluation). After one year of instruction, there were significant impacts on phonemic decoding, word reading accuracy and fluency, and comprehension for 3rd graders, but not for 5th graders. For third graders in the reading programs, the gap in word attach skills between struggling readers and average readers was reduced by about two-thirds. It was found that reading skills of 3rd graders can be significantly improved through instruction in word-level skills, but not the reading skills of 5th graders.

Although many countries have implemented school feeding programs, few programs have been rigorously evaluated. We conducted a randomized, controlled trial of giving breakfast to undernourished and adequately nourished children. The undernourished group comprised 407 children in grades 2-5 in 16 rural Jamaican schools (weights-for-age -1 SD). Both groups were stratified by class and school, then randomly assigned to breakfast or control groups. After the initial measurements, breakfast was provided every school day for 1 school year. Children in the control group were given one-quarter of an orange and the same amount of attention as children in the breakfast group. All children had their heights and weights measured and were given the Wide Range Achievement Test before and after the intervention. School attendance was taken from the schools' registers. Compared with the control group, height, weight, and attendance improved significantly in the breakfast group. Both groups made poor progress in Wide Range Achievement Test scores. Younger children in the breakfast group improved in arithmetic. There was no effect of nutritional group on the response to breakfast. In conclusion, the provision of a school breakfast produced small benefits in children's nutritional status, school attendance, and achievement. Greater improvements may occur in more undernourished populations; however, the massive problem of poor achievement levels requires integrated programs including health and educational inputs as well as school meals.",Nutrition and education: a randomized trial of the effects of breakfast in rural primary school children,https://www.google.com/search?q=Nutrition+and+education:+a+randomized+trial+of+the+effects+of+breakfast+in+rural+primary+school+children,1998,Targeted,Regular Teachers/Lecturers,Full Academic Year or Longer,Numeracy/Maths,None,Single,814,16,Yes,Whole Sample Only,Immediate Post-Test Only,Yes,"Yes, But Not Reported","Yes, Descriptive Theory of Change",Yes,Central/South America Primary/Elementary Physical Health and Wellbeing
3031164,Asia,Primary/Elementary,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"Although children in both cities and rural areas in China have nearly universal rates of participation between grades 1 and 9, there is still a performance gap between urban and rural students especially students from poor rural areas. In 2005 over 80% of urban students graduated from academic or vocational high schools. However, less than 40% of rural students from poor counties graduated from high school. In China's large municipalities almost 50% of students graduated from college or some other tertiary educational institution. On why is it that educational outcomes of rural students deteriorate so rapidly after grade 9, one reason may be that after grade 9 matriculation to high school and access to quality educational programs become competitive and dependent on test scores. If rural students do not perform as well as urban students at the time that they are entering high school, they will naturally fall behind. Adapted from the source document.

METHODS: We randomized medical students to a 30-minute hands-on (group 1) and a 30-minute demonstration (group 2) training session teaching a standardized shoulder dystocia management scheme on a pelvic training model. Participants were tested with a 22-item Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills scoring system after training and 72 hours thereafter. Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills scores were the primary outcome. Performance time, self-assessment, confidence, and global rating scale were the secondary outcomes. Statistics were performed using Mann-Whitney U test, chi test, and multiple linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Two hundred three participants were randomized.

METHOD: A total of 65 high schools from 14 school districts across the United States were randomized to one of three conditions: regular workshop training, comprehensive implementation support, or standard care control. Physical education and health teachers delivered the program to students (n=2538). Program effectiveness was assessed with dichotomous measures of 30-day substance use at baseline and one-year follow-up. RESULTS: When the program conditions were considered in aggregate and compared to controls, the program showed a marginally significant effect in lowering marijuana use from baseline to the one-year follow-up. Significant program effects on hard drug use were achieved for baseline non-users only. There were no differences in the effects of the two program conditions. CONCLUSION: Positive outcomes may be achieved by trained teachers when they implement Project TND in real-world high school environments; however, program effects are likely to be weaker than those achieved in efficacy trials.

One strategy for reducing such violence is to increase the likelihood that youth will intervene when they see peers engaging in disrespectful and abusive behaviors. Purpose: This 12-month follow-up of a cluster RCT examined the longer-term effectiveness of Coaching Boys Into Men, a dating violence prevention program targeting high school male athletes. Design: This cluster RCT was conducted from 2009 to 2011. The unit of randomization was the school, and the unit of analysis was the athlete. Data were analyzed in 2012. Setting/participants: Participants were male athletes in Grades 9ï¿½11 (N = 1513) participating in athletics in 16 high schools. Intervention: The intervention consisted of training athletic coaches to integrate violence prevention messages into coaching activities through brief, weekly, scripted discussions with athletes. Main outcome measures: Primary outcomes were intentions to intervene, recognition of abusive behaviors, and gender-equitable attitudes. Secondary outcomes included bystander behaviors and abuse perpetration. Intervention effects were expressed as adjusted mean between-arm differences in changes in outcomes over time, estimated via regression models for clustered, longitudinal data. Results: Perpetration of dating violence in the past 3 months was less prevalent among intervention athletes relative to control athletes, resulting in an estimated intervention effect of -0.15 (95% CI = -0.27, -0.03). Intervention athletes also reported lower levels of negative bystander behaviors (i.e., laughing and going along with peersï¿½ abusive behaviors) compared to controls (ï¿½0.41, 95% CI = -0.72, -0.10). No differences were observed in intentions to intervene (0.04, 95% CI = -0.07, 0.16); gender-equitable attitudes (-0.04, 95% CI = -0.11, 0.04); recognition of abusive behaviors (ï¿½0.03, 95% CI = -0.15, 0.09); or positive bystander behaviors (0.04, 95% CI = -0.11, 0.19). Conclusions: This school athleticsï¿½based dating violence prevention program is a promising approach to reduce perpetration and negative bystander behaviors that condone dating violence among male athletes.

DESIGN AND SETTING: Sixty-one public schools in Chicago were recruited to participate, were grouped into neighborhood study units and assigned randomly to intervention or 'delayed program' control condition. PARTICIPANTS: The study sample (n = 5812 students) was primarily African American, Hispanic and low-income. INTERVENTION: Students, beginning in sixth grade (age 12 years), received 3 years of intervention strategies (curricula, family interventions, youth-led community service projects, community organizing). MEASUREMENTS: Students participated in yearly classroom-based surveys to measure their alcohol use and related risk and protective factors. Additional evaluation components included a parent survey, a community leader survey and alcohol purchase attempts. FINDINGS: Overall, the intervention, compared with a control condition receiving 'prevention as usual', was not effective in reducing alcohol use, drug use or any hypothesized mediating variables (i.e. related risk and protective factors). There was a non-significant trend (P = 0.066) that suggested the ability to purchase alcohol by young-appearing buyers was reduced in the intervention communities compared to the control communities, but this could be due to chance. Secondary outcome analyses to assess the effects of each intervention component indicated that the home-based programs were associated with reduced alcohol, marijuana and tobacco use combined (P = 0.01), with alcohol use alone approaching statistical significance (P = 0.06).

3030885,UK/Ireland,Primary/Elementary,Numeracy/Maths,"; Background: Large-scale randomised controlled trials (RCT) are relatively rare in education. The present study was an attempt to scale up previous small peer tutoring projects, while investing only modestly in continuing professional development for teachers. Purpose: A two-year RCT of peer tutoring in mathematics was undertaken in one local education authority in Scotland. The relative effectiveness of cross-age vs same-age tutoring, light vs intensive intervention, and mathematics vs mathematics + reading tutoring was investigated. Programme description: The intervention was Duolog Math, a freely available tutoring method for working with mathematical problems, involving discussion following eight structured steps and including summarising and generalising at the end. Sample: Eighty-six primary schools in one council in Scotland of average socio-economic status. Children were of mixed ability and mixed gender, with few ethnic minorities or special needs in relation to background population. Macro-evaluation n = 3520. Micro-evaluation Year 1 n = 334, Year 2 n = 447 cf. comparison group n = 85. Design and methods: Almost all the primary schools in the local authority participated and were randomly allocated to condition. A macro-evaluation tested and retested using Performance Indicators in Primary Schools over a two-year period. A micro-evaluation tested and retested within each year using a criterion-referenced test of mathematical problem solving. Macro-evaluation was with multi-level modelling, micro-evaluation with descriptive statistics and effect sizes; ANCOVA and MANOVA. Results: Macro-evaluation yielded significant pre-post gains in mathematics attainment for cross-age tutoring in randomly allocated classes over both years. No other differences were significant. Micro-evaluation yielded pre-post gains for selected schools in Year 1, but no overall gains for randomly allocated schools in Year 2 compared with comparisons. However, Year 2 girls, mathematics-only groups and less able students did gain significantly. Conclusions: Duolog Math tutoring does lead to gains in mathematics attainment compared with students not participating, but only for cross-age tutoring and girls, mathematics-only groups and less able mathematicians.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of a 4-year specialist-taught Physical Education (PE) program on physical activity (PA) among primary school children.

Methods
A 4-year cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted in children (initially aged 8 years) from 29 primary schools (13 Intervention, 16 Control). Intervention students (N = 457) received 2 × 45 min PE lessons per week from specialist-trained PE teachers (68 lessons per year, 272 lessons over 4 years). Control group students (N = 396) received usual practice PE from generalist classroom teachers. PA during PE lessons was examined using the System for Observing Fitness Instruction Time (SOFIT). Pedometers (steps/day) were worn for 7 days each year, and accelerometers were worn concurrently in the final two years to assess moderate to vigorous (MVPA) and sedentary activity. Linear and generalized mixed models were used to determine differences in Intervention and Control student PA and the proportion of students meeting PA guidelines.

Results
The intervention increased SOFIT-observed student MVPA during PE lessons by 6.5 mins (16.7 v 10.2, p < 0.001). Within intervention schools, participants increased their whole-day step counts (boys = 449 [CI,140 to 756]; girls = 424 [CI,222 to 626]) and minutes of MVPA (boys = 8.0 [CI,6.8 to 9.2]; girls = 3.5 [CI,1.7 to 5.4]) on PE days. However, compared to the Control group the Intervention did not: increase habitual steps/day or MVPA when averaged over 7 days; elicit greater improvements in these measures over time; or increase the odds of meeting step/day or MVPA recommendations. At age 11 years Intervention group boys were 20 mins less sedentary per day (380 [CI,369 to 391] vs 360 [CI,350 to 369]) and this effect was sustained at age 12 years.

Conclusions
Well-designed specialist-taught PE can improve student PA during PE lessons. However for PE to be a significant contributor to improving habitual PA in pre-adolescent children, daily classes are likely to be required, and even this would need to be supplemented with a wider multicomponent strategy. Our finding of a reduction in sedentary time among Intervention boys warrants further investigation into the potential role PE could play in influencing sedentary behaviour.","Outcomes of a four-year specialist-taught physical education program on physical activity: a cluster randomized controlled trial, the

3031560,Rest of Europe,Primary/Elementary,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the effects of URMEL-ICE, a German school-based intervention for overweight prevention, on children's BMI and other measures of fat mass. METHODS: A cluster-randomised controlled design was used. The intervention which focused on physical activity, TV time and soft drink consumption was integrated into a second-grade curriculum and was implemented by classroom teachers themselves. It comprised 29 teaching lessons, 2 short exercise blocks per day and 6 family homework lessons. BMI was assessed as primary outcome measure, waist circumference and skinfold thickness as secondary outcomes. Data of 945 children were analysed. RESULTS: Multivariate analyses adjusted for baseline values showed no statistically significant effect of the intervention on BMI, but on waist circumference (-0.85; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) -1.59 to -0.12) and subscapular skinfold thickness (-0.64; 95% CI -1.25 to -0.02). After additional adjustment for individual time lag between baseline and follow-up, these effects were reduced to -0.60 (95% CI -1.25 to 0.05) and -0.61 (95% CI -1.26 to 0.04) and lost their statistical significance. CONCLUSION: This study contributes to the field of randomised school-based studies on overweight prevention and shows that within a 1-year, integrated intervention no effect on BMI, but a tendency towards effects on fat mass can be achieved.",Overweight prevention implemented by primary school teachers: a randomised controlled trial,https://www.google.com/search?q=Overweight+prevention+implemented+by+primary+school+teachers:+a+randomised+controlled+trial,2012,Universal,Regular Teachers/Lecturers,Full Academic Year or Longer,none,none,Clustered,945,32,No,Some Sub-Groups Reported,At Least Some Follow-Up,Yes,"Yes, Fairly Well","Yes, Descriptive Theory of Change",Yes,Rest of Europe Primary/Elementary Physical Health and Wellbeing
3030928,USA/Canada,Primary/Elementary,Behaviour and Social Wellbeing,"The purpose of this study is to test the effects on children's social, behavioral, and academic outcomes of an intervention, Families and Schools Together (FAST), when implemented in two novel ways: (a) in schools with predominantly Latino children and (b) on an entire grade-level cohort instead of with individual families targeted for the intervention. The FAST program is a multi-family group prevention program that is implemented in three stages: (a) active outreach to engage parents; (b) an 8-week program of weekly multi-family group meetings; and (c) 2 years of follow-up monthly parent-led meetings. Previous randomized controlled trials have demonstrated positive effects of FAST on reducing child aggression and improving teacher-reported academic outcomes (Abt Associates, 2001; Kratochwill et al., 2004; McDonald et al., 2006). In these studies, children (or, in one case, classrooms) were targeted for the intervention and then matched pairs were randomly assigned to treatment or control. In this study, by contrast, schools were designated by participating school districts in San Antonio, Texas, and Phoenix, Arizona, and then schools were randomly assigned within district to treatment or control, enabling the authors to recruit the entire first-grade cohort of treatment schools for participation in FAST. At this point, results are available only for the first 8 schools (fall administration of Year 1). Consequently, only suggestive findings can be reported, and the authors confine themselves to simple descriptions of treatment-control comparisons rather than the full multilevel models.

Method: The preventive intervention was implemented when the children were between 7 and 9 years and included three components (i.e. social skills, parental practices, teacher support). Participants (N = 250) were randomly allocated to the intervention or to a control group. The tested pathways included antisocial behaviour, school engagement, parental supervision and friends' deviancy, both during early and middle adolescence.

3030884,Africa,Primary/Elementary,Literacy/English,"This paper provides experimental evidence on the impact of tracking primary school students by initial achievement. In the presence of positive spillover effects from academically proficient peers, tracking may be beneficial for strong students but hurt weaker ones. However, tracking may help everybody if heterogeneous classes make it difficult to teach at a level appropriate to most students. We test these competing claims using a randomized evaluation in Kenya. One hundred and twenty one primary schools which all had a single grade one class received funds to hire an extra teacher to split that class into two sections. In 60 randomly selected schools, students were randomly assigned to sections. In the remaining 61 schools, students were ranked by prior achievement (measured by their first term grades), and the top and bottom halves of the class were assigned to different sections. After 18 months, students in tracking schools scored 0.14 standard deviations higher than students in non-tracking schools, and this effect persisted one year after the program ended. Furthermore, students at all levels of the distribution benefited from tracking. A regression discontinuity analysis shows that in tracking schools scores of students near the median of the pre-test distribution score are independent of whether they were assigned to the top or bottom section. In contrast, in non-tracking schools we find that on average, students benefit from having academically stronger peers. This suggests that tracking was beneficial because it helped teachers focus their teaching to a level appropriate to most students in the class.",Peer Effects and the Impact of Tracking: Evidence from a Randomized Evaluation in Kenya.

3031908,Africa,Primary/Elementary,Range of Academic Outcomes,"To the extent that students benefit from high-achieving peers, tracking will help strong students and hurt weak ones. However, all students may benefit if tracking allows teachers to better tailor their instruction level. Lower-achieving pupils are particularly likely to benefit from tracking when teachers have incentives to teach to the top of the distribution. We propose a simple model nesting these effects and test its implications in a randomized tracking experiment conducted with 121 primary schools in Kenya. While the direct effect of high-achieving peers is positive, tracking benefited lower-achieving pupils indirectly by allowing teachers to teach to their level.

3031855,Rest of Europe,College/University,Professional Training,"OBJECTIVES: This study (a post-intervention assessment) was designed to assess the effectiveness of peer-assisted learning (PAL) using student-teachers (STs) with limited training to teach complicated technical skills for interpreting ultrasound images of the shoulder. METHODS: Students in Years 3 and 4 of medical school were randomly assigned to two groups. In the PAL group (PG), teaching was delivered by a group of nine STs from Years 3 and 4, who undertook a 30-minute general training and 1 week of self-teaching. In the staff-led group (SG), students were taught by a group of three ultrasound-experienced doctors. Exposure took place in two separate lessons (each of 120 minutes) and introduced eight standard sectional planes (EULAR) using a 10-MHz Nemio XG system (Toshiba Medical Systems GmbH). The theoretical and practical learning outcomes were tested using a multiple-choice question (MCQ) test and an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE). Qualitative differences were evaluated using Likert scale-based items. RESULTS: Evaluation of differences between the PG (n = 75) and SG (n = 76) in the theoretical (MCQ score; P = 0.644) and practical (total OSCE score; P = 0.133) outcomes showed no difference between the two groups. However, the STs themselves showed significantly better results overall (P < 0.05). Staff members were rated more highly than STs, especially on items relating to competence (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Complicated technical skills can be adequately taught to students using the PAL system by STs with limited training. Self-teaching learning strategies are successful in contexts of limited teacher training.

Methods: In this cluster-randomized controlled trial, 4 high schools in Irbid, Jordan, were randomly assigned to receive the Adolescent Asthma Action program or standard practice. Bilingual health workers trained 24 peer leaders from Year 11 to deliver asthma education to younger peers from Year 10 (n = 92), who in turn presented brief asthma skits to students in Years 8 and 9 (n = 148) and to other members of the school community in the intervention schools. Students with asthma (N = 261) in Years 8, 9, and 10 completed baseline surveys in December 2006 and 3 months after the intervention. Results: Students from the intervention group reported clinically significant improvements in health-related quality of life (mean difference: 1.35 [95% confidence interval: 1.04ï¿½1.76]), self-efficacy to resist smoking (mean difference: 4.63 [95% confidence interval: 2.93ï¿½6.35]), and knowledge of asthma self-management (mean difference: 1.62 [95% confidence interval: 1.15ï¿½2.19]) compared with the control group. Conclusions: This trial demonstrated that the Adolescent Asthma Action program can be readily adapted to suit different cultures and contexts.

DESIGN AND SETTING: Randomised controlled trial in the Medical School, University of Birmingham, UK. PARTICIPANTS: 122 first-year medical, dental, nursing and physiotherapy students. INTERVENTIONS: Students were randomised to receive basic life support tuition from either second-year student instructors or from experienced clinical staff. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Students' practical skills, knowledge and satisfaction were tested at the end of the course. Instructor reliability was assessed throughout the course. Students taught by their peers were significantly more likely to be successful in the end-of-course practical CPR test than those taught by clinical staff (56/57 vs. 53/62). The student instructors were also found to be more reliable than clinical staff at attending the training sessions (48/48 vs. 36/48).

METHOD: In 2001, 80 interns from three university internal medicine residencies completed questionnaires about their experiences with pelvic examinations. Interns who were available for training underwent baseline assessment of their pelvic examination skills and were randomized to training or to a control group that received only educational literature. Skills were assessed with a 29-item checklist at baseline and at follow-up by evaluators blinded to group assignment, and interrater agreement was estimated by review of audiotapes. RESULTS: Seventy-two interns were randomized and underwent baseline skills assessment. Seventy interns returned for follow-up assessment after approximately 14 weeks (range, 10-17 weeks). The 39 interns randomized to training and 33 randomized to the control group did not differ with respect to age, gender, or prior pelvic examination training. In both groups there was substantial variability in skills at baseline, with graduates of U.S. medical schools scoring significantly higher than did graduates of non-U.S. medical schools (0.66 versus 0.41, p < 10(-5)).

METHODS: Twenty-four elementary schools were cluster randomized to the Physical Activity Across the Curriculum intervention or served as control. All children in grades two and three were followed to grades four and five. Physical Activity Across the Curriculum promoted 90 min/wk of moderate to vigorous intensity physically active academic lessons delivered by classroom teachers. Body Mass Index was the primary outcome, daily Physical activity and academic achievement were secondary outcomes. RESULTS: The three-year change in Body Mass Index for Physical Activity Across the Curriculum was 2.0+/-1.9 and control 1.9+/-1.9, respectively (NS). However, change in Body Mass Index from baseline to 3 years was significantly influenced by exposure to Physical Activity Across the Curriculum. Schools with > or =75 min of Physical Activity Across the Curriculum/wk showed significantly less increase in Body Mass Index at 3 years compared to schools that had <75 min of Physical Activity Across the Curriculum (1.8+/-1.8 vs. 2.4+/-2.0, p=0.02). Physical Activity Across the Curriculum schools had significantly greater changes in daily Physical activity and academic achievement scores.

8155128,Rest of Europe,Primary/Elementary,Range of Academic Outcomes,"OBJECTIVES: Using physical activity in the teaching of academic lessons is a new way of abstract
learning. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of an innovative physically
active academic intervention (“Fit & Vaardig op School” [F&V]) on academic achievement of
children.
METHODS: Using physical activity to teach math and spelling lessons was studied in a clusterrandomized
controlled trial. Participants were 499 children (mean age 8.1 years) from
second- and third-grade classes of 12 elementary schools. At each school, a second- and
third-grade class were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. The
intervention group participated in F&V lessons for 2 years, 22 weeks per year, 3 times a
week. The control group participated in regular classroom lessons. Children’s academic
achievement was measured before the intervention started and after the first and second
intervention years. Academic achievement was measured by 2 mathematics tests (speed
and general math skills) and 2 language tests (reading and spelling).
RESULTS: After 2 years, multilevel analysis showed that children in the intervention group
had significantly greater gains in mathematics speed test (P < .001; effect size [ES] 0.51),
general mathematics (P < .001; ES 0.42), and spelling (P < .001; ES 0.45) scores. This equates
to 4 months more learning gains in comparison with the control group. No differences were
found on the reading test.

spelling performance of elementary school children and are therefore a promising new way
of teaching.","Physically Active Math and

We use qualitative and quantitative data from a pilot trial to build hypotheses regarding these. METHODS: The Healthy School Ethos intervention involved two schools being provided with facilitation, training, and funding to plan and implement actions (some mandatory and some locally determined) to improve school ethos over one year. The evaluation involved a pilot-trial with two intervention and two comparison schools; semi-structured interviews with facilitators, staff, and students; and baseline and follow-up surveys with students aged 11 to 12 years. RESULTS: Student accounts linked participation in planning or delivering intervention activities with improved self-regard and relationships with staff and other students. Some activities such as re-writing school rules involved broad participation. Students in receipt of actions such as peer-mediation or motivational sessions reported benefits such as improved safety and relationships. Some student accounts linked improved self-regard and relationships with increased engagement and aspirations, and reduced substance use. At 9-month follow-up, students in intervention schools reported less hurting and teasing of others and feeling unsafe at school. Other outcomes suggested intervention benefits but were not significant.

Therefore, we compared the transfer of training for the laparoscopic cholecystectomy from porcine cadaver organs vs virtual simulation to surgery in a live animal model in a prospective randomized trial. Design After completing an intensive training in basic laparoscopic skills, 3 groups of 10 participants proceeded with no additional training (control group), 5 hours of cholecystectomy training on cadaver organs (= organ training) or proficiency-based cholecystectomy training on the LapMentor (= virtual-reality training). Participants were evaluated on time and quality during a laparoscopic cholecystectomy on a live anaesthetized pig at baseline, 1 week (= post) and 4 months (= retention) after training. Setting All research was performed in the Center for Surgical Technologies, Leuven, Belgium. Participants In total, 30 volunteering medical students without prior experience in laparoscopy or minimally invasive surgery from the University of Leuven (Belgium). Results The organ training group performed the procedure significantly faster than the virtual trainer and borderline significantly faster than control group at posttesting. Only 1 of 3 expert raters suggested significantly better quality of performance of the organ training group compared with both the other groups at posttesting (p < 0.01). There were no significant differences between groups at retention testing. The virtual trainer group did not outperform the control group at any time.

Objective: To determine how physicians might change their behavior after learning about the Medicare rule. Design: We conducted a randomized trial of a brief educational intervention embedded in an online survey, using clinical vignettes to estimate behavioral changes. Participants: At a university-based internal medicine residency program, 168 internal medicine residents were eligible to participate. Intervention: Residents were randomized to receive a one-page description of Medicareï¿½s ï¿½no pay for errorsï¿½ rule with pre-vignette reminders (intervention group) or no information (control group). Residents responded to five clinical vignettes in which ï¿½no pay for errorsï¿½ conditions might be present on admission. Main Measures: Primary outcome was selection of the single most clinically appropriate option from three clinical practice choices presented for each clinical vignette. Key Results: Survey administered from December 2008 to March 2009. There were 119 responses (71%). In four of five vignettes, the intervention group was less likely to select the most clinically appropriate response. This was statistically significant in two of the cases. Most residents were aware of the rule but not its impact and specifics. Residents acknowledged responsibility to know Medicare documentation rules but felt poorly trained to do so. Residents educated about the Medicareï¿½s ï¿½no pay for errorsï¿½ were less likely to select the most clinically appropriate responses to clinical vignettes. Such choices, if implemented in practice, have the potential for causing patient harm through unnecessary tests, procedures, and other interventions.

Computer-based attention training holds great promise as a way for schools to address this problem. The aim of this project is to evaluate the efficacy of two computer-based attention training systems in schools. One program uses neurofeedback (NFB) to train children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) to focus on a task, and the other uses a Standard Computer Format (SCF) for cognitive retraining. The authors hypothesize that 1) both treatments will result in improvement in ADHD symptoms compared to a control condition; and 2) both treatments will result in improvement in academic outcomes compared to a control condition. This research is on-going and takes place in 19 elementary schools that accepted to participate in the project. The schools are part of two school systems in the greater Boston area.

Participants in this study were low-income children ages 4 to 5 attending early childhood education centers and the teachers in these children's classrooms. The study is part of the 'Ready to Learn Initiative,' a program to develop educational television programming and outreach activities that increase school readiness for 2- to 8-year-old children living in low-income households. In 2005, the U.S. Department of Education awarded one of two 'Ready to Learn Initiative' programming cooperative agreements to the Public Broadcasting System (PBS) and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB). Because the cooperative agreements emphasized scientifically based reading research, CPB commissioned the Education Development Center, Inc. and SRI International to collaborate as its external summative evaluation partner. The results show that digital media, including public television programming and web-based games, can support early literacy skills when thoughtfully integrated with teacher-led interactive activities. Although children in each group improved their literacy scores, children in the early literacy condition showed significantly more improvement than those in the comparison condition. In the study, educators with limited experience in implementing early literacy curricula of this level of intensity helped achieve these results with a diverse sample of low-income children. Key features of the curriculum were a strong focus on the early literacy skills critical for later reading success, opportunities for practice and reinforcement through multiple tasks (including hands-on, teacher-led, child-initiated, and technology-based activities), and integration with teacher-led activities that focus on the same skills.

Method A total of 61 children (48 males) with autism, 29 to 60 months of age, had earlier been randomized either to 8 weeks of preschool-based social communication treatment in addition to standard preschool program (n = 34) or to standard preschool program only (n = 27). Significant short-term effects on targeted social communication skills have previously been published. Long-term gains in social communication, language and global social functioning and communication were assessed from video-taped preschool teacher-child and mother-child interactions, Early Social Communication Scales, Reynell Developmental Language Scale, and Social Communication Questionnaire. Results Compared with those in the control group, the treated children achieved significantly larger improvements in joint attention and joint engagement from baseline to 12-month follow-up. However, no effects were detected on language and global ratings of social functioning and communication. The treatment effect on child initiation of joint attention increased with increasing level of sociability at baseline, whereas nonverbal IQ and expressive language had no moderating effect. Conclusions This study is the first to show that, similar to specialist-delivered treatment, preschool-based treatment may produce small but possibly clinically important long-term changes in social communication in young children with autism. The treatment did not affect language and global ratings of social functioning and communication.

In the Chicago randomized control trial (RCT) of PA, a dynamic cohort of low-income students were followed from grade 3 until grade 8 (N=1,170 students from 14 urban schools across eight waves), and surveys were used to examine program effects on numerous outcomes. To date, we have demonstrated program effects in the PA-Chicago RCT on a compositemeasure of grade 8 substance use; separate longitudinal mediation analyses showed changes in SECD and deviant peer affiliationmediated the program's impact on the substance use composite. In this paper, we determined 1) the impact of PA on specific drinking-and smoking-related behaviors, and 2) whether changes in selfcontrol (one component of the larger SECD measure; e.g., I keepmy temper) and 3) changes in deviant peer affiliation (e.g., how many of the respondent's friends bully others) serve as mediators. Doing so allowed us to determine whether PA is particularly effective for preventing specific types of substance use, and whethermediators varied by type of substance. We used intent-to-treat longitudinal mediation analyses with bootstrapping to test the bivariate and mediated effects of PA on binary measures (i.e., ever use) of alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana; a total of six mediation models were estimated (onemodel for eachmediator-outcome combination).

Prevention is important, and schools have long been seen as appropriate settings for pre-emptive interventions with this high risk group. This paper evaluates the effectiveness, in relation to alcohol harm prevention, of the Drug Education in Victorian Schools (DEVS) programme, nine months after implementation. This intervention dealt with both licit and illicit drugs, employed a harm minimisation approach that incorporated interactive, skill based, teaching methods and capitalised on parental influence through home activities. Methods: A cluster randomised, controlled trial of the first ten lessons of the DEVS drug education programme was conducted with year eight students, aged 13-14 years. Twenty-one secondary schools in Victoria, Australia were randomly allocated to receive the DEVS programme (14 schools, n=1163) or the drug education usually provided by their schools (7 schools, n=589). Self-reported changes were measured in relation to: knowledge and attitudes, communication with parents, drug education lessons remembered, proportion of drinkers, alcohol consumption (quantity multiplied by frequency), proportion of student drinkers engaging in risky consumption, and the number of harms experienced as a result of alcohol consumption. Results: In comparison to the controls, there was a significantly greater increase in the intervention students' knowledge about drugs, including alcohol (p<. 0.001); there was a significant change in their level of communication with parents about alcohol (p=0.037); they recalled receiving significantly more alcohol education (p<. 0.001); their alcohol consumption increased significantly less (p=0.011); and they experienced a lesser increase in harms associated with their drinking (p<. 0.001). There were no significant differences between the two study groups in relation to changes in attitudes towards alcohol or in the proportion of drinkers or risky drinkers. There was, however, a notable trend of less consumption by risky drinkers in the intervention group.

Lifetime alcohol use in the ITT analysis (i.e., school level) achieved statistical significance, with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.70 and a NNT of 14.8. The NNT suggests that in a school where CHOICE was offered, 1 adolescent out of 15 was prevented from initiating alcohol use during this time period. Although not statistically significant (p?=?.20), results indicate that past month alcohol use was also lower in CHOICE schools (OR = 0.81; NNT = 45). Comparisons of attenders versus matched controls yielded results for lifetime use similar to school-wide effects (OR = 0.74 and NNT = 17.6).

METHODS: Fifty-seven adolescents with elevated depression symptoms were randomized to receive Interpersonal Psychotherapy-Adolescent Skills Training (IPT-AST) or school counseling (SC). Hierarchical linear modeling examined differences in rates of change in depression symptoms and overall functioning and analysis of covariance examined mean differences between groups. Rates of depression diagnoses in the 18-month follow-up period were compared. RESULTS: Adolescents in IPT-AST reported significantly greater rates of change in depression symptoms and overall functioning than SC adolescents from baseline to post-intervention. At post-intervention, IPT-AST adolescents reported significantly fewer depression symptoms and better overall functioning. During the follow-up phase, rates of change slowed for the IPT-AST adolescents, whereas the SC adolescents continued to show improvements. By 12-month follow-up, there were no significant mean differences in depression symptoms or overall functioning between the two groups. IPT-AST adolescents reported significantly fewer depression diagnoses in the first 6 months following the intervention but by 12-month follow-up the difference in rates of diagnoses was no longer significant. CONCLUSIONS: IPT-AST leads to an immediate reduction in depression symptoms and improvement in overall functioning. However, the benefits of IPT-AST are not consistent beyond the 6-month follow-up, suggesting that the preventive effects of the program in its current format are limited.

The handler and dog demonstrated various 'dos and don'ts' of behavior around dogs and the Ss practiced patting the dog in the correct manner and precautionary and protective body posture to adopt when approached or knocked over by a dog. A resource kit for teachers, included activities to be undertaken before and after the demonstration, was also distributed. Seven to 10 days after participating in the program, Ss were let out to play unsupervised in the school grounds where a docile Labrador dog was tethered 5 meters away from its owner. The Ss were not told that the dog was there and were videotaped by a hidden camera for 10 min. Ss who had received the intervention displayed appreciably greater precautionary behavior than Ss who had not received the intervention. The educational program increased appreciably the precautionary behavior of young children around strange dogs in the short term.

3031733,Rest of Europe,Middle/High School,Behaviour and Social Wellbeing,"Background: There are a high number of adolescents who are at risk of developing an eating disorder. There is, therefore, a strong need to implement prevention programs aimed at reducing the incidence of eating disorders at this critical age. Among other factors, successful prevention programs have been shown to be interactive, carried out by professionals, focused on educational as well as psychosocial elements and have taken risk factors as well as resources into account. The objective of this study protocol is to present the design of a new prevention program for eating disorders in schools. Methods/Design: The gender-adapted prevention program extends over six school hours. It contains interactive and educational elements about eating disorders and their treatment. Participants pass through different exercises and reflect on the influences of the media, self-esteem, body perception and individual resources. A cluster-randomized controlled trial is chosen to evaluate the program. Based on an estimated effect size of d = 0.3 a total of 1848 participants are enrolled in the study. Eating disorder risk, internalization of Western beauty ideals, body dissatisfaction, self-concept as well as anxiety and symptoms of depression are measured before and immediately after the intervention as well as at a six-month follow-up. In addition, the intervention group evaluates the different components of the program. Discussion: The study intends to test the practicability and efficacy of an interactive, gender-adapted ED prevention program in schools. Moreover, it will provide valuable information about the occurrence of eating disorder risk factors in school-aged children. Trial registration: ISRCTN97989348 ; Registered 19 December 2012.

By this the scheme aims to make the biomechanically correct use of the spinal column spontaneous. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The application of the scheme in the frame of physical education in a primary school was investigated in a prospective controlled study in the school-year of 2001/2002. Participating children were aged 6 to 14. The intervention group (n=200) regularly did the posture correction exercises with their teacher's direction in physical education classes, while the control group (n=213) did not. The 12 test exercises of the posture correction scheme of the Hungarian Spine Society were tested by an independent physiotherapist at the beginning and at the end of the school-year in both groups. Results were analyzed by paired and unpaired t-tests and by a chi-square test. RESULTS: At the end of the school-year the strength and flexibility of the postural muscles of the intervention group improved significantly compared both to their own performance (p<0.01) at the beginning of the school-year and to the control group. Test results of the control group were significantly (p<0.05) worse at the end of the school-year than their own results at beginning of the school-year, and were more significantly (p<0.01) worse than the test results of intervention group. CONCLUSION: The results of the controlled study confirm that regular use of the preventive exercises in physical education improves the strength and flexibility of postural muscles.

3031246,Rest of Europe,College/University,Professional Training,"Since its first implementation in a medical programme at McMaster University, Canada, problem-based learning (PBL) has become a well-established means of teaching and learning medicine. Extensive research has been conducted and a number of strengths of the method are well supported. Several items, however, remain unclear although there is evidence that no relevant difference exists in factual knowledge among students from PBL and traditional curricula, a controlled, randomized study has not been conducted to address this issue. The Medical Faculty of the University of Cologne is in the process of integrating elements of PBL into its curriculum. In the spring term of 1997, after seven semesters of experience with PBL supplementing the traditional course of basic pharmacology, we did for the first time use PBL instead of the lecture-based course (LBL) and conducted a controlled prospective study to determine the effects of this intervention. One-hundred and twenty-three students were randomly assigned to either PBL (n = 63), with tutorial groups of up to nine students, or to the traditional, lecture-based course (n = 60). Analysis of the results of both groups in the examination of basic pharmacology, consisting of multiple-choice and short-essay questions, revealed similar scores with a tendency favouring PBL students in the category of short-essay questions. Hence, it seems clear that PBL does not imply a disadvantage in terms of factual knowledge. Students considered PBL to be an effective learning method and favoured it over the lecture format. Furthermore, students reported positive effects of PBL in terms of use of additional learning resources, interdisciplinarity, team work and learning fun.","Problem-based learning versus lecture-based learning in a course of basic pharmacology: a controlled, randomized study","https://www.google.com/search?q=Problem-based+learning+versus+lecture-based+learning+in+a+course+of+basic+pharmacology:+a+controlled,+randomized+study",2012,Universal,Regular Teachers/Lecturers,Between Half and Full Term,Professional Training,Professional Training,Single,123,NA,Yes,Whole Sample Only,Immediate Post-Test Only,Yes,No,"Yes, Descriptive Theory of Change",Yes,Rest of Europe College/University Professional Training

Although performance feedback procedures have been shown to produce promising short-term improvements in elementary-aged students' writing skills, evidence of maintenance and generalization of these intervention effects is limited. The purpose of this study was to examine the immediate, generalized, and sustained effects of incorporating multiple exemplar training into the performance feedback procedures of a writing intervention using a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Results indicated that although the addition of multiple exemplar training did not improve students' writing performance on measures of stimulus and response generalization, it did result in greater maintenance of intervention effects in comparison to students who received performance feedback without generality programming and students who engaged in weekly writing practice alone.

Self-instruction programming often is used to help youth that are at high risk for dropout and drug abuse to complete their high school education. However, a health educator-led program is much more interactive. METHODS: The effects of self-instruction versus health educator-led versions of this curriculum were examined. Eighteen schools were randomly assigned by block to one of three conditions--standard care (control), health educator-led classroom program, and self-instruction classroom program. Subjects were followed up 1 and 2 years later. Two-year results are reported here. RESULTS: The self-instruction program produced no behavioral effects relative to the standard care control condition. The 2-year follow-up results indicated maintenance of program effects on cigarette smoking and hard drug use in the health educator-led version.

Thirty-three 7th Grade boys (mean age=12.5+/-0.4 years) were randomly assigned to intervention (n=16) or active comparison group (n=17). The intervention consisted of one 60-minute curriculum session and two 20-minute lunchtime physical activity sessions per week. The active comparison group continued with their usual physical activity curriculum sessions (Friday afternoons 2-3 pm).

This consisted of a teacher-led curriculum, learning resources, and homework tasks. Primary outcome measures were waist circumference, body mass index (BMI), and BMI z-scores. Secondary outcomes were objectively-assessed physical activity and sedentary time, and food intake. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, at post-intervention (20 weeks), and at follow-up (30 weeks). Data were analysed using 2-level multi-level modelling (levels: school, student) and adjusted for baseline values of the outcomes and potential confounders.

The Michigan Model for Health (MMH) was implemented and evaluated to determine its impact on multiple health issues, including social and emotional skills, prosocial behavior, and drug use and aggression. Methods: Schools (N = 52) were randomly assigned to intervention and control conditions. Participants received 24 lessons in grade 4 (over 12 weeks) and 28 more lessons in grade 5 (over 14 weeks), including material focusing on social and emotional health, interpersonal communication, social pressure resistance skills, drug use prevention, and conflict resolution skills. The 40-minute lessons were taught by the classroom or health teacher who received curriculum training and provided feedback on implementation fidelity. Self-report survey data were collected from the fourth-grade students (n = 2512) prior to the intervention, immediately after the intervention, and 6 weeks after the intervention, with the same data collection schedule repeated in fifth grade. Results: Students who received the curriculum had better interpersonal communication skills, social and emotional skills, and drug refusal skills than the control group students. Intervention students also reported lower intentions to use alcohol and tobacco, less alcohol and tobacco use initiated during the study and in the past 30 days, and reduced levels of aggression.

3031533,Rest of Europe,Middle/High School,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"BACKGROUND: Adolescents are a risk group for acquiring sexually transmitted infections (STIs). In the Netherlands, senior vocational school students are particular at risk. However, STI test rates among adolescents are low and interventions that promote testing are scarce. To enhance voluntary STI testing, an intervention was designed and evaluated in senior vocational schools. The intervention combined classroom health education with sexual health services at the school site. The purpose of this study was to assess the combined and single effects on STI testing of health education and school-based sexual health services. METHODS: In a cluster-randomized study the intervention was evaluated in 24 schools, using three experimental conditions: 1) health education, 2) sexual health services; 3) both components; and a control group. STI testing was assessed by self reported behavior and registrations at regional sexual health services. Follow-up measurements were performed at 1, 3, and 6-9 months. Of 1302 students present at baseline, 739 (57%) completed at least 1 follow-up measurement, of these students 472 (64%) were sexually experienced, and considered to be susceptible for the intervention. Multi-level analyses were conducted. To perform analyses according to the principle of intention-to-treat, missing observations at follow-up on the outcome measure were imputed with multiple imputation techniques. Results were compared with the complete cases analysis. RESULTS: Sexually experienced students that received the combined intervention of health education and sexual health services reported more STI testing (29%) than students in the control group (4%) (OR = 4.3, p < 0.05). Test rates in the group that received education or sexual health services only were 5.7% and 19.9%, not reaching statistical significance in multilevel analyses. Female students were more often tested then male students: 21.5% versus 5.4%. The STI-prevalence in the study group was low with 1.4%. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a low dose of intervention that was received by the students and a high attrition, we were able to show an intervention effect among sexually experienced students on STI testing. This study confirmed our hypothesis that offering health education to vocational students in combination with sexual health services at school sites is more effective in enhancing STI testing than offering services or education only.","Promoting STI testing among senior vocational students in Rotterdam, the Netherlands: effects of a cluster randomized study","https://www.google.com/search?q=Promoting+STI+testing+among+senior+vocational+students+in+Rotterdam,+the+Netherlands:+effects+of+a+cluster+randomized+study",2011,Universal,External Educators,Up to Half a Term,Physical Health and Wellbeing,None,Clustered,1302,24,Yes,Some Sub-Groups Reported,At Least Some Follow-Up,Yes,No,"Yes, Descriptive Theory of Change",Yes,Rest of Europe Middle/High School Physical Health and Wellbeing

3031791,USA/Canada,College/University,Professional Training,"BACKGROUND: Advanced surgical skills such as laparoscopic suturing are difficult to learn in an operating room environment. The use of simulation within a defined skills-training curriculum is attractive for instructor, trainee, and patient. This study examined the impact of a curriculum-based approach to laparoscopic suturing and knot tying. STUDY DESIGN: Senior surgery residents in a university-based general surgery residency program were prospectively enrolled and randomized to receive either a simulation-based laparoscopic suturing curriculum (TR group, n=11) or standard clinical training (NR group, n=11). During a laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication, placement of two consecutive intracorporeally knotted sutures was video recorded for analysis. Operative performance was assessed by two reviewers blinded to subject training status using a validated, error-based system to an interrater agreement of >or=80%. Performance measures assessed were time, errors, and needle manipulations, and comparisons between groups were made using an unpaired t-test. RESULTS: Compared with NR subjects, TR subjects performed significantly faster (total time, 526+/-189 seconds versus 790+/-171 seconds; p < 0.004), made significantly fewer errors (total errors, 25.6+/-9.3 versus 37.1+/-10.2; p < 0.01), and had 35% fewer excess needle manipulations (18.5+/-10.5 versus 27.3+/-8.6; p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Subjects who receive simulation-based training demonstrate superior intraoperative performance of a highly complex surgical skill.

METHOD: A cohort sequential design included 28 public school districts randomly assigned to the partnership delivery system or usual-programming conditions. At baseline, 11,960 students participated. Partnerships supported community teams that implemented a family-focused intervention in 6th grade and a school-based intervention in 7th grade. Outcome measures included lifetime, current misuse, and frequencies of misuse, for a range of substances. Intent-to-treat, multilevel analyses of covariance of point-in-time misuse and analyses of growth in misuse were conducted. RESULTS: Results showed significantly lower substance misuse in the intervention group at one or both time points for most outcomes, with relative reduction rates of up to 31.4%. There was significantly slower growth in misuse in the intervention group for 8 of the 10 outcomes. In addition, risk moderation results indicated that there were significantly greater intervention benefits for higher- versus lower-risk youth, for the misuse of 6 of the 10 substances at 11th grade, illicit substances at 12th grade, and growth in the misuse of illicit substances.

One hundred and sixteen mainstream kindergarten and first-grade children, from low socioeconomic backgrounds, scoring below the 25th percentile on a measure of visual-motor integration (VMI) were recruited and randomly divided into two parallel intervention groups. One intervention group received directive visual-motor intervention (DVMI), while the second intervention group received a non-directive supportive intervention (NDSI). Tests were administered to evaluate visual-motor integration skills outcome. Children with higher baseline measures of psychological adjustment and self-esteem responded better in NDSI while children with lower baseline performance on psychological adjustment and self-esteem responded better in DVMI. This study suggests that children from low socioeconomic backgrounds with low VMI performance scores will benefit more from intervention programs if clinicians choose the type of intervention according to baseline psychological adjustment and self-esteem measures.

3030998,UK/Ireland,Middle/High School,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"Background: Improvement of sex education in schools is a key part of the UK government's strategy to reduce teenage pregnancy in England. We examined the effectiveness of one form of peer-led sex education in a school-based randomised trial of over 8,000 pupils. Methods: 29 schools were randomised to either peer-led sex education (intervention) or to continue their usual teacher-led sex education (control). In intervention schools, peer educators aged 16-17 years delivered three sessions of sex education to 13-14 year-old pupils from the same schools. Primary outcome was unprotected (without condom) first heterosexual intercourse by age 16 years. Analysis was by intention to treat. Findings: By age 16 years, significantly fewer girls reported intercourse in the peer-led arm than in the control arm, but proportions were similar for boys. The proportions of pupils reporting unprotected first sex did not differ for girls (8.4% intervention vs 8.3% control) or for boys (6.2% vs 4.7%). Stratified estimates of the difference between arms were -0.4% (95% CI -3.7% to 2.8%, p=0.79) for girls and -1.4% (-4.4% to 1.6%, p=0.36) for boys. At follow-up (mean age 16.0 years [SD 0.32]), girls in the intervention arm reported fewer unintended pregnancies, although the difference was borderline (2.3% vs 3.3%, p=0.07). Girls and boys were more satisfied with peer-led than teacher-led sex education, but 57% of girls and 32% of boys wanted sex education in single-sex groups. Interpretation: Peer-led sex education was effective in some ways, but broader strategies are needed to improve young people's sexual health.

3031079,Australia/New Zealand,Middle/High School,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"Purpose: Recent studies suggest that approximately a quarter of Australian youth are overweight or obese. While evidence suggests that socio-economic status is related to physical inactivity, poor dietary habits and obesity among adolescents, no previous obesity prevention program in Australia has specifically targeted economically disadvan-taged adolescent boys. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of a school-based intervention on unhealthy weight gain, physical activity and physical fitness among low-active adolescent boys from disadvantaged schools. Methods: Participants were 100 adolescent boys from four secondary schools located in the Hunter Region. Following baseline assessments, four schools were randomised to the Physical Activity Leaders (PALs) intervention (n = 50) or a wait list control (n = 50) group. The PALs intervention was developed in reference to Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory and was designed to encourage participants to become physical activity leaders in their homes and at school. The intervention included interactive seminars, health-related fitness sessions during school sport and at lunch-time, pedometers for self-monitoring and activities designed to engage parents in physical activity and healthy eating. Participants were assessed at baseline, 3-month and 6-month follow-up on the following outcomes: height, weight, BMI z-score, waist circumference (umbilicus), body fat (bio-electrical impedance) and muscular fitness (isometric leg strength test, 7-stage sit-up test, push-up test). In addition, participants wore pedometers for 5-days at baseline and 6-month follow-up. Results: The mean (SD) age of participants was 14.3 (0.6) years.

It has the objective of improving the understanding of disorders of mental health in the rural community. We aimed to assess the impact of a school mental-health programme on the awareness of schoolchildren, their parents, friends who were not attending school, and neighbours. METHODS: We chose two secondary schools for boys and two for girls that were similar in terms of size, staff-pupil ratio, and drop-out rates. 100 children aged 12-16 years (25 girls and 25 boys in each of the study and control groups), 100 parents (one for each child), 100 friends who did not attend school (one for each child), and 100 neighbours (one for each child) were given a 19-item questionnaire before and after the study group had had a 4-month programme of mental-health education. The maximum score for the questionnaire was 16 points. FINDINGS: Before the school mental-health programme the awareness of mental-health issues was poor (mean score 5.7-7.6) in the four groups of participants. In the study group there was a significant improvement in the mean scores after the school programme in the schoolchildren (mean improvement 7.6 [95% CI 6.7-8.5], p<0.01), their parents (5.3 [4.5-6.1], p<0.01), friends (5.1 [4.1-6.1], p<0.01), and neighbours (3.4 [2.6-4.2], p<0.01).

3031452,USA/Canada,Multiple,Other School Subjects,"Background: Unstuck and On Target (UOT) is an executive function (EF) intervention for children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) targeting insistence on sameness, flexibility, goal?setting, and planning through a cognitive?behavioral program of self?regulatory scripts, guided/faded practice, and visual/verbal cueing. UOT is contextually?based because it is implemented in school and at home, the contexts in which a child uses EF skills. Methods: To evaluate the effectiveness of UOT compared with a social skills intervention (SS), 3rdï¿½5th graders with ASD (mean IQ = 108; UOT n = 47; SS n = 20) received interventions delivered by school staff in small group sessions. Students were matched for gender, age, race, IQ, ASD symptomotolgy, medication status, and parents' education. Interventions were matched for ï¿½doseï¿½ of intervention and training. Measures of preï¿½post change included classroom observations, parent/teacher report, and direct child measures of problem?solving, EF, and social skills. Schools were randomized and evaluators, but not parents or teachers, were blinded to intervention type. Results: Interventions were administered with high fidelity. Children in both groups improved with intervention, but mean change scores from pre? to postintervention indicated significantly greater improvements for UOT than SS groups in: problem?solving, flexibility, and planning/organizing. Also, classroom observations revealed that participants in UOT made greater improvements than SS participants in their ability to follow rules, make transitions, and be flexible. Children in both groups made equivalent improvements in social skills. Conclusions: These data support the effectiveness of the first contextually?based EF intervention for children with ASD.

3031705,Australia/New Zealand,Middle/High School,Behaviour and Social Wellbeing,"Objective: The Resourceful Adolescent Program (RAP) is a universal, school-based intervention that has been found to produce small to medium effects in the reduction of adolescent depressive symptoms. In the present study, we evaluated the effectiveness of a friendship-building skills program - the Peer Interpersonal Relatedness (PIR) program - in producing larger effects when used in conjunction with RAP. Method: A cluster-randomized controlled trial was used to assign whole classrooms of adolescent participants recruited from Sydney secondary schools to 1 of 3 conditions: (a) RAP-PIR, (b) RAP-placebo, or (c) assessment-only waiting-list control. Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) was used to analyze the data. Results: Across the intervention period, RAP did not significantly reduce depressive symptoms relative to those students not receiving this intervention. RAP followed by PIR did significantly reduce depressive symptoms relative to those students not receiving PIR. Across the 12-month follow-up, the between-group reductions in depressive symptoms were no longer significant. At follow-up, participants in the RAP-PIR condition had achieved significant increases in their school-related life satisfaction and significant increases in social functioning with peers relative to their peers in the other conditions. Conclusion: The study provides preliminary support for the effectiveness of the PIR program in reducing depressive symptoms when used alongside RAP in the short term and in improving social adjustment and school-related life satisfaction in the longer term. Given the importance of social adjustment in adolescent mental well-being, the PIR program represents a potentially important addition to the prevention of depression in youth. 2014 American Psychological Association.",Randomized controlled trial of a friendship skills intervention on adolescent depressive symptoms,https://www.google.com/search?q=Randomized+controlled+trial+of+a+friendship+skills+intervention+on+adolescent+depressive+symptoms,2014,Universal,Regular Teachers/Lecturers,Between Half and Full Term,None,None,Clustered,210,4,Yes,Whole Sample Only,Immediate Post-Test Only,Yes,No,"Yes, Descriptive Theory of Change",No,Australia/New Zealand Middle/High School Behaviour and Social Wellbeing

Early health education in schools is the most appropriate preventive action. Objectives: To describe attitudes to smoking, experimentation and smoking habits in secondary school students and to modify attitudes to reduce experimentation and tobacco use. Material and method: We performed a controlled, open trial with randomization by uniform clusters (classroom). The intervention group (IG) consisted of 159 students and the control group (CG) of 73. Design: Preparation of material and staff training (October-December 2000). Data on students was gathered by means of an anonymized standardized questionnaire (the FRISC questionnaire; December 2000). The teachers applied the standard program to the CG and the study program to the IG (January-April 2001). First evaluation (April 2001) and second evaluation (December 2001), using the FRISC questionnaire. Results: December 2000: 55.8% of the students had experimented with tobacco, 10.2% smoked daily and 4.6% smoked weekly. The IG had 1.9% more daily smokers and 12.7% more students that had experimented with smoking than the CG.

Seventeen intervention and 15 control schools participated in a controlled trial. Baseline knowledge and attitudes were measured in year 8 students (ages 13-14 years) and their teachers together with quality of life in the students with asthma. A three-lesson package about asthma was delivered by teachers as part of the Personal Development/Health/Physical Education (PD/H/PE) curriculum. Follow-up questionnaires were administered to students and staff. Efforts to change school policies were documented. Five years after the intervention, PD/H/PE teachers were contacted to determine whether the program was still operating. Main outcome measures included asthma knowledge, attitudes, and quality of life. Questionnaires were returned by 4,161/4,475 of the year 8 students at baseline and by 3,443 at follow-up. In intervention schools, compared with control schools, students showed improved asthma knowledge (P < 0.0001), improvement in tolerance to asthma (P = 0.02), internal control (P = 0.03), and less tendency to believe in the role of chance in asthma control (P = 0.04). Students from intervention but not control schools showed significant improvements in overall quality of life (P = 0.003 vs. P = 0.82, respectively). Teachers from intervention schools showed significant increases in knowledge compared to control schools (P < 0.0001). Intervention schools were more likely to seek further health education about asthma (P < 0.01).

Participants (61% male; 51% mandated; 84% Caucasian; M age = 20.14 years) were screened for heavy drinking and randomized to BASICS (n = 115) or assessment-only control (n = 110). Outcome measures (drinking, alcohol problems) were collected at baseline, 4 weeks, 3, 6, and 12 months postintervention. At 4 weeks postintervention, intent-to-treat multilevel longitudinal models showed that regardless of referral group (mandated or volunteer), BASICS significantly decreased weekly drinking, typical drinks, and peak drinks relative to controls (ds = .41ï¿½.92). BASICS had a large effect on decreases in alcohol problems (d = .87). At 12 months postintervention, BASICS participants (regardless of referral group) reported significantly fewer alcohol problems (d = .56) compared with controls. Significant long-term intervention gains for peak and typical drinks were sustained in both referral groups relative to controls (ds = .42; .11).

3031870,USA/Canada,College/University,Professional Training,"Background: Narrow band imaging (NBI) has been shown to be more effective in identifying Barrett's esophagus (BE) associated neoplasia compared to standard endoscopic imaging. While previous studies have shown that NBI can be taught to inexperienced gastroenterologists, it is unknown whether in-person training sessions are more effective than self-directed training programs. Aim: Compare the accuracy of diagnosing BE associated neoplasia for trainees with no prior NBI experience between in-classroom and self-directed didactic training programs. Methods: Gastroenterology (GI) fellows and medical students with no prior experience with NBI in BE at 2 tertiary referral centers were randomized to two groups (inclassroom didactic training program and a self-directed didactic training program). Randomization was stratified by years of prior endoscopy exposure and study center. A PowerPoint presentation was developed that taught participants basic information about NBI, how the NBI mucosal and vascular patterns differ between non-dysplastic BE and BE with areas of high grade dysplasia/cancer (HGD/CA), and reviewed examples of NBI images in both non-dysplastic BE and BE with HGD/CA. Subjects randomized to the in-classroom program attended a single session where an endoscopist with expertise in NBI in BE reviewed the PowerPoint presentation and answered questions from the trainees. Subjects randomized to the self-directed program received an automated version of the PowerPoint presentation with audio. Afterwards, subjects in both groups completed a test of 40 randomized NBI images (22 non-dysplastic, 18 HGD/CA) and were asked to predict the histology along with their confidence level in optical diagnosis. The post-training scores were compared using Fisher's exact test. Results: 12 medical students and 21 GI fellows were enrolled. There was no difference in accuracy between the in-classroom and selfdirected groups, however the in-classroom group had a significantly higher percentage of high confidence answers. (Table 1) When limited to high confidence answers, there was no significant difference in accuracy and overall accuracy rates remained less than 70%. There was no significant difference in overall accuracy or accuracy with high confidence predictions between the two study sites or between GI fellows and medical students. (Table 2) Conclusion: We found that the overall accuracy of NBI patterns for BE were modest when testing trainees with no previous NBI experience and there was no difference between self-directed and in-classroom didactic training.

While prevention of injuries is an important goal, prevention efforts are currently fragmented, poorly funded, and rarely studied. Among school-aged children, pedestrian crashes are a major mechanism of injury. We hypothesized that we could develop a game-based educational tool that would be effective in teaching elementary school children the principles of pedestrian safety. METHODS: Between November 2011 and June 2013, second- and third-grade children in Los Angeles Unified School District were randomly assigned to play a unique interactive video game (Ace's Adventure) about pedestrian safety or to a traditional didactic session about pedestrian safety. A pretest and posttest were administered to the study participants. Afterward, study participants were observed for appropriate pedestrian behavior on a simulated street set called Street Smarts. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2. RESULTS: A total of 348 study participants took the pretest and posttest. There were 180 who were randomized to the didactic and 168 who were randomized to the video game. The didactic group demonstrated a higher mean score increase (1.01, p < 0.0001) as compared with the video game group (0.44, p < 0.0001). However, observation of study participants revealed that participants who played the video game, as compared with the didactic group, more frequently exhibited appropriate behavior during the following: exiting a parked car (p = 0.01), signaling to a car that was backing up (p = 0.01), signaling to a stopped car (p = 0.0002), and crossing the street (p = 0.01).

DESIGN: Randomized trial, with children stratified by smoke exposure in the home and randomized to a school-based care group or a usual care control group. SETTING: Rochester, New York. PARTICIPANTS: Children aged 3 to 10 years with persistent asthma. INTERVENTIONS: Directly observed administration of daily preventive asthma medications by school nurses (with dose adjustments according to National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Expert Panel guidelines) and a home-based environmental tobacco smoke reduction program for smoke-exposed children, using motivational interviewing. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Mean number of symptom-free days per 2 weeks during the peak winter season (November-February), assessed by blinded interviews. RESULTS: We enrolled 530 children (74% participation rate).

Intervention effects were detected at both grade levels (but not on all outcome measures). MLM was also used to evaluate the mediating effect of intervention implementation integrity on intervention effects. The integrity with which the intervention was implemented in intervention classrooms predicted end-of-year standardized measures of mathematics achievement and growth on curriculum-based measures. Implications for mathematics instruction in general and mathematics intervention within response to intervention models are discussed.

3031789,USA/Canada,Middle/High School,Study-Related Skills,"Although youth mentoring is popular in the United States, and beginning to gain popularity in other countries, dissemination efforts have preceded the establishment of a strong evidence-base for this service. This is particularly true in mentoring programs that are based in schools, which constitute the most popular form of mentoring. The first portion of the paper will offer an overview of youth mentoring by providing (a) a definition of youth mentoring, (b) the rational for using mentors in schools to promote academic and life success, (c) an overview of mentoring typologies, (d) and a summary of the current outcome literature related to youth mentoring programs with particular emphasis on school-based mentoring programs. Based on this literature review, I propose that programmatic research that applies psychological theory to mentoring policies and procedures that are subsequently rigorously evaluated is needed to achieve substantial and dependable benefits from school-based mentoring programs. Consistent with this recommendation, this thesis reports on a efficacy trial of an innovative mentoring program that takes theory and research from psychotherapy, social learning theory, and adolescent development and applies these to a novel transitional mentoring program for middle-school students transitioning from elementary school. In the present study, 120 first year middle school students were randomly assigned to a school-based transitional mentoring program or a wait list control group during the first semester of middle school. Hierarchical linear models were used to assess students change in student grades associated with randomization over the first semester of middle school. Results from this evaluation suggest that random assignment to the mentoring program was associated with statistically significant decreases in reading grades and null effects on other measures including school and teacher connectedness.

Paraprofessionals or special educators recruited, trained, and supported 106 peers to provide individualized academic and social assistance to students with severe disabilities throughout one semester. Compared to students exclusively receiving adult-delivered support (n = 48), students participating in peer support arrangements experienced increased interactions with peers, increased academic engagement, more progress on individualized social goals, increased social participation, and a greater number of new friendships.

This trial assessed whether the intervention resulted in (1) reduced prevalence of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) assessed clinically and/or (2) sustained use of hearing protection devices. METHODS: In 1992-1996, 34 rural Wisconsin schools were recruited and 17 were assigned randomly to receive a comprehensive, 3-year, hearing conservation intervention. In 2009-2010, extensive efforts were made to find and contact all students who completed the original trial. Participants in the 16-year follow-up study completed an exposure history questionnaire and a clinical audiometric examination. Rates of NIHL and use of hearing protection were compared. RESULTS: We recruited 392 participants from the original trial, 200 (53%) from the intervention group and 192 (51%) from the control group. Among participants with exposure to agricultural noise, the intervention group reported significantly greater use of hearing protection compared with the control group (25.9% vs 19.6%; P = .015). The intervention group also reported significantly greater use of hearing protection for shooting guns (56.2% vs 41.6%; P = .029), but the groups reported similar uses of protection in other contexts. There was no significant difference between groups with respect to objective measures of NIHL.

3031270,UK/Ireland,Middle/High School,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"Background: To date, no school-based intervention has been proven to be effective in preventing adolescent smoking, despite continuing concern about smoking levels amongst young people in the United Kingdom. Although formal teacher-led smoking prevention interventions are considered unlikely to be effective, peer-led approaches to reducing smoking have been proposed as potentially valuable. Methods/design: ASSIST (A Stop Smoking in Schools Trial) is a comprehensive, large-scale evaluation to rigorously test whether peer supporters in Year 8 (age 11-12) can be recruited and trained to effect a reduction in smoking uptake among their fellow students. The evaluation is employing a cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) design with secondary school as the unit of randomisation, and is being undertaken in 59 schools in South East Wales and the West of England. Embedded within the trial are an economic evaluation of the intervention costs, a process evaluation to provide detailed information on how the intervention was delivered and received, and an analysis of social networks to consider whether such a peer group intervention could work amongst schoolchildren in this age group. Schools were randomised to either continue with normal smoking education (n = 29 schools, 5562 students), or to do so and additionally receive the ASSIST intervention (n = 30 schools, 5481 students). No schools withdrew once the trial had started, and the intervention was successfully implemented in all 30 schools, with excellent participation rates from the peer supporters. The primary outcome is regular (weekly) smoking, validated by salivary cotinine, and this outcome has been obtained for 94.4%, 91.0% and 95.6% of eligible students at baseline, immediate post-intervention, and one-year follow-up respectively. Discussion: Comprehensive evaluations of complex public health interventions of this scale and nature are rare in the United Kingdom. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of conducting cluster RCTs of complex public health interventions in schools, and how the rigour of such designs can be maximised both by thorough implementation of the protocol and by broadening the scope of questions addressed in the trial by including additional evaluative components. 2005 Starkey et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Rationale, design and conduct of a comprehensive evaluation of a school-based peer-led anti-smoking intervention in the UK: The ASSIST cluster randomised trial ISRCTN55572965","https://www.google.com/search?q=Rationale,+design+and+conduct+of+a+comprehensive+evaluation+of+a+school-based+peer-led+anti-smoking+intervention+in+the+UK:+The+ASSIST+cluster+randomised+trial+ISRCTN55572965",2005,Universal,Mixture,Between Half and Full Term,None,None,Clustered,11043,59,Yes,NA,At Least Some Follow-Up,NA,NA,NA,NA,UK/Ireland Middle/High School Physical Health and Wellbeing

Based on a component analysis, six measures of WM were grouped into composites representing Visual, Auditory and Manipulation WM. Results: The training group had significant long-term differential gains compared to the control group on all outcome measures. Performance gains for the training group were significantly higher in the visual domain than in the auditory domain. The differential gain in Manipulation WM persisted after controlling for an increase in simple storage capacity.

Methods: This randomised controlled trial evaluated the effectiveness of a reading and language intervention for 6-year-old children identified by research criteria as being at risk of dyslexia (n = 56), and their school-identified peers (n = 89). An Experimental group received two 9-week blocks of daily intervention delivered by trained teaching assistants; the Control group received 9 weeks of typical classroom instruction, followed by 9 weeks of intervention. Results: Following mixed effects regression models and path analyses, small-to-moderate effects were shown on letter knowledge, phoneme awareness and taught vocabulary. However, these were fragile and short lived, and there was no reliable effect on the primary outcome of word-level reading. Conclusions: This new intervention was theoretically motivated and based on previous successful interventions, yet failed to show reliable effects on language and literacy measures following a rigorous evaluation.

A spelling training program already in use at the school serves as the control condition. A total of 37 second- and third-graders rated by their teachers as spelling disabled participated in the study. In addition to their regular lessons, the children received two added lessons in small tutoring groups each week. The skills of the children in the tutoring program had increased significantly two years later regardless of the method used. This effect was confirmed both by tests as well as by teachers' and parental reports. The children's emotional attitudes towards school failed to change significantly. The control group that had received no tutoring improved as well. Tutoring spelling disabled children in small groups is an effective method for improving their reading and spelling abilities. The fact that the skills of children in the control group without any tutoring also improved raises a number of questions. The choice of method in our study had no effect on the outcome. Our study was unable to systematically evaluate a number of potential influences; these should be investigated further.

Objective Investigate reciprocal learning with task cards as instructional model for teaching BLS and the effect of instructor expertise in BLS on learning outcomes. Methods There were 175 students (mean age = 18.9 years) randomized across a reciprocal/BLS instructor (RBI) group, a reciprocal/non-BLS instructor (RNI) group, and a traditional/BLS instructor group (TBI). In the RBI and RNI group, students were taught BLS through reciprocal learning with task cards. The instructor in the RBI group was certified in BLS by the European Resuscitation Council. In the TBI, students were taught BLS by a certified instructor according to the Belgian Red Cross instructional model. Student performance was assessed 1 day (intervention) and 3 weeks after intervention (retention). Results At retention, significantly higher BLS performances were found in the RBI group (M = 78%), p = 0.007, ES = 0.25, and the RNI group (M = 80%), p < 0.001, Effect Size (ES) =.36, compared to the TBI (M = 73%). Significantly more students remembered and performed all BLS skills in the experimental groups at intervention and retention. No differences in BLS performance were found between the reciprocal groups. Ventilation volumes and flow rates were significantly better in the TBI at intervention and retention.

3031240,NA,NA,NA,"Background/Objectives: Social contact is known to reduce stigma and social contact-based interventions are being increasingly used in anti-stigma programmes in mental health. Recorded interventions, such as audiovisual DVDs, may act as an indirect form of social contact and may have practical and cost advantages, but little is known about their effectiveness. To compare the effectiveness of a DVD and a live mental health service user intervention and a lecture control, in reducing stigma. We hypothesised that: (i) there will be no difference between the DVD (indirect social contact with people affected by mental illness) and live (direct social contact) delivery modes; and (ii) the interventions with some form of social contact (DVD or live) will be more effective than a control with no social contact (lecture). Methods: Student nurses in their university foundation year were randomly allocated to (i) watch a DVD recording of service users and carers talking about their experiences, (ii) hear a live presentation by a service user and carer, or (iii) attend a lecture on mental health awareness and stigma. Outcomes were measured post-session and at four months follow-up. The primary outcome was stigmatising attitudes (Mental Illness Clinicians' Attitudes scale, MICA). Secondary stigma-related outcomes were: emotional reactions to people with mental illness (Emotional Reactions to Mental Illness Scale, ERMIS), intended social proximity (Reported and Intended Behaviour Scale, RIBS), knowledge (Social Contact Interventions Leaning Outcomes scale, SCILO), and intended disclosure and intended healthcare seeking (two items only measured at follow up). Participants' views, process variables and cost comparisons were also assessed. Two sets of comparisons were made following our hypotheses: (1) DVD versus live and (2) social contact with people affected by mental illness (indirect or direct i.e. DVD or live) versus no social contact (lecture). Results: 360 participants were randomised and 216 attended the interventions. Post-session data were collected for all participants and the response rate at four months follow-up was 89% (193/216). Results will be presented on the effectiveness of the interventions, on cost comparisons, on process variables, and on participants' views.

Using circle time games, the study examined whether participating in a treatment group significantly improved behavioral self-regulation and early academic outcomes. Half of the children were randomly assigned to participate in 16 playgroups during the winter of the school year. Behavioral aspects of self-regulation and early achievement were assessed in the fall and spring. Although there was no treatment effect in the overall sample, post hoc analyses revealed that participation in the treatment group was significantly related to self-regulation gains in children who started the year with low levels of these skills. Children in the treatment group also demonstrated significant letter-word identification gains compared to children in the control group. Practice or Policy: The findings from this study provide preliminary evidence for the efficacy of the intervention in terms of improving preschoolers' behavioral self-regulation for children low in these skills and improving letter-word identification. Although preliminary, these results have the potential to inform preschool curricula that emphasize behavioral self-regulation as a means of facilitating school readiness.

In this study, we report the results of a randomized controlled trial of Tools for Getting Along (TFGA), a social problem-solving universally delivered curriculum designed to reduce the developmental risk for serious emotional or behavioral problems among upper elementary grade students. We analyzed pre-intervention and post-intervention teacher-report and student self-report data from 14 schools, 87 classrooms, and a total of 1296 students using multilevel modeling. Results (effect sizes calculated using Hedges' g) indicated that students who were taught TFGA had a more positive approach to problem solving (g = 0.11) and a more rational problem-solving style (g = 0.16). Treated students with relatively poor baseline scores benefited from TFGA on (a) problem-solving knowledge (g = 1.54); (b) teacher-rated executive functioning (g = 0.35 for Behavior Regulation and 0.32 for Metacognition), and proactive aggression (g = 0.20); and (c) self-reported trait anger (g = 0.17) and anger expression (g = 0.21).

Attempts to combat this stigma through educational initiatives have had mixed results. This study examined the impact of a one-time contact-based educational intervention on the stigma of mental illness among medical students and compared this with a multimodal undergraduate psychiatry course at the University of Calgary, Canada that integrates contact-based educational strategies. Attitudes towards mental illness were compared with those towards type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A cluster-randomized trial design was used to evaluate the impact of contact-based educational interventions delivered at two points in time. The impact was assessed by collecting data at 4 time points using the Opening Minds Scale for Health Care Providers (OMS-HC) to assess changes in stigma. Baseline surveys were completed by 62% (n=111) of students before the start of the course and post-intervention ratings were available from 90 of these. Stigma scores for both groups were significantly reduced upon course completion (p < 0.0001), but were not significantly changed following the one-time contact based educational intervention in the primary analysis. Student confidence in working with people with a mental illness and interest in a psychiatric career was increased at the end of the course. Stigma towards mental illness remained greater than for T2DM at all time points. Psychiatric education can decrease the stigma of mental illness and increase student confidence. However, one-time, contact-based educational interventions require further evaluation in this context.

Methods Of 24 secondary schools (62% of those approached), 12 were randomly assigned to intervention and 12 as controls. Intervention students received a social relationship curriculum; their parents received parent education handbooks and invitations to parent education events outlining strategies to encourage healthy adolescent development and reduce adolescent alcohol misuse. At Wave 1 (2004), students were in Year 7 secondary school (mean age, 12.3 years). Data were imputed for students completing at least two of three annual surveys (N = 2,354). Wave 3 (2006; mean, 14.5 years) main outcome measures for alcohol use were 'any,' 'frequent' (at least monthly), and 'heavy' (five or more drinks in a session at least once in the prior fortnight). Multivariate logistic regression assessed intervention exposure effects, adjusting for school classroom clustering and baseline measures. Results Relative to controls, intervention students showed significant reductions in any lifetime use (adjusted odds ratio [AOR],.78; 95% confidence interval [CI],.62-.97), and reduced progression to frequent (AOR,.69; CI,.56-.86) and heavy use (AOR,.75; CI,.60-.94). Conclusions Randomized assignment to Resilient Families was associated with a significant reduction in adolescent alcohol use among families volunteering for the evaluation.

Despite this attention, there is not an abundance of research comparing its effectiveness to other potential interventions. The current study presents the findings from a randomized control trial study involving the assignment of 168 second grade students to a RR, wide reading (WR), or business as usual condition. Intervention students were provided with 9ï¿½10 weeks of intervention with sessions occurring four times per week. Pre- and post-testing were conducted using Woodcock-Johnson III reading achievement measures (Woodcock, McGrew, & Mather, 2001, curriculum-based measurement (CBM) probes, measures of prosody, and measures of students' eye movements when reading. Changes in fluency were also monitored using weekly CBM progress monitoring procedures. Data were collected on the amount of time students spent reading and the number of words read by students during each intervention session. Results indicate substantial gains made by students across conditions, with some measures indicating greater gains by students in the two intervention conditions. Analyses do not indicate that RR was superior to WR. In addition to expanding the RR literature, this study greatly expands research evaluating changes in reading behaviors that occur with improvements in reading fluency. Implications regarding whether schools should provide more opportunities to repeatedly practice the same text (i.e., RR) or practice a wide range of text (i.e., WR) are provided.

They were also more likely to know the correct actions to take in a house fire and on finding tablets (OR 2.80 (95% CI 1.08 to 7.22) and OR 3.50 (95% CI 1.18 to 10.38) respectively) and correctly demonstrated more safety skills than control group children (difference between means 11.9% (95% CI 1.4% to 22.5%)). There was little evidence to suggest the first year of the program impacted on self-reported safety behaviours. CONCLUSIONS: The Risk Watch program delivered by teachers in primary schools increased some aspects of children's safety knowledge and skills and primary schools should consider delivering this program.

3031353,Asia,Multiple,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"Objective: To determine whether an education programme targeted at schoolchildren could lower salt intake in children and their families. Design: Cluster randomised controlled trial, with schools randomly assigned to either the intervention or control group. Setting: 28 primary schools in urban Changzhi, northern China. Participants: 279 children in grade 5 of primary school, with mean age of 10.1; 553 adult family members (mean age 43.8). Intervention: Children in the intervention group were educated on the harmful effects of salt and how to reduce salt intake within the schoolsï¿½ usual health education lessons. Children then delivered the salt reduction message to their families. The intervention lasted for one school term (about 3.5 months). Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was the difference between the groups in the change in salt intake (as measured by 24 hour urinary sodium excretion) from baseline to the end of the trial. The secondary outcome was the difference between the two groups in the change in blood pressure. Results: At baseline, the mean salt intake in children was 7.3 (SE 0.3) g/day in the intervention group and 6.8 (SE 0.3) g/day in the control group. In adult family members the salt intakes were 12.6 (SE 0.4) and 11.3 (SE 0.4) g/day, respectively. During the study there was a reduction in salt intake in the intervention group, whereas in the control group salt intake increased. The mean effect on salt intake for intervention versus control group was &minus;1.9 g/day (95% confidence interval &minus;2.6 to &minus;1.3 g/day; P < 0.001) in children and &minus;2.9 g/day (&minus;3.7 to &minus;2.2 g/ day; P < 0.001) in adults. The mean effect on systolic blood pressure was &minus;0.8 mm Hg (&minus;3.0 to 1.5 mm Hg; P = 0.51) in children and &minus;2.3 mm Hg (&minus;4.5 to &minus;0.04 mm Hg; P < 0.05) in adults. Conclusions: An education programme delivered to primary school children as part of the usual curriculum is effective in lowering salt intake in children and their families. This offers a novel and important approach to reducing salt intake in a population in which most of the salt in the diet is added by consumers.

3031113,Central/South America,Middle/High School,Behaviour and Social Wellbeing,"IMPORTANCE: Depression can have devastating effects unless prevented or treated early and effectively. Schools offer an excellent opportunity to intervene with adolescents presenting emotional problems. There are very few universal school-based depression interventions conducted in low- and middle-income countries. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of a school-based, universal psychological intervention to reduce depressive symptoms among adolescents from low-income families. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A 2-arm, parallel, cluster, randomized clinical trialwas conducted in secondary schools in deprived socioeconomic areas of Santiago, Chile. Almost all students registered in the selected schools consented to take part in the study. A total of 2512 secondary school students from 22 schools and 66 classes participated. INTERVENTIONS: Students in the intervention arm attended 11 one-hour weekly and 2 booster classroom sessions of an intervention based on cognitive-behavioral models. The intervention was delivered by trained nonspecialists. Schools in the control arm received the standard school curriculum. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Scores on the self-administered Beck Depression Inventory-II at 3 months (primary) and 12 months (secondary) after completing the intervention. RESULTS: There were 1291 participants in the control arm and 1221 in the intervention arm. Primary outcome data were available for 82.1% of the participants. There was no evidence of any clinically important difference in mean depression scores between the groups (adjusted difference in mean, -0.19; 95%CI, -1.22 to 0.84) or for any of the other outcomes 3 months after completion of the intervention. No significant differences were found in any of the outcomes at 12 months. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A well-designed and implemented school-based intervention did not reduce depressive symptoms among socioeconomically deprived adolescents in Santiago, Chile. There is growing evidence that universal school interventions may not be sufficiently effective to reduce or prevent depressive symptoms.

Schools can promote public health objectives by increasing physical activity among youth. METHODS: The Child and Adolescent Trial for Cardiovascular Health (CATCH) was a multicenter, randomized trial to test the effectiveness of a cardiovascular health promotion program in 96 public schools in four states. A major component of CATCH was an innovative, health-related physical education (P+) program. For 2.5 years, randomly assigned schools received a standardized PE intervention, including curriculum, staff development, and follow-up. RESULTS: Systematic analysis of 2,096 PE lessons indicated students engaged in more moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in intervention than in control schools (P = 0.002). MVPA during lessons in intervention schools increased from 37.4% at baseline to 51.9%, thereby meeting the established Year 2000 objective of 50%. Intervention children reported 12 more min of daily vigorous physical activity (P = 0.003) and ran 18.6 yards more than control children on a 9-min run test of fitness (P = 0.21).

The aim was to assess whether a psycho?educational intervention increased adolescents' cancer awareness and addressed help?seeking barriers. Methods: This was a cluster randomised controlled trial involving 2173 adolescents in 20 schools. The intervention was a 50?min presentation delivered by a member of Teenage Cancer Trust's (UK charity) education team. Schools were stratified by deprivation and roll size and randomly allocated to intervention/control conditions within these strata. Outcome measures were the number of cancer warning signs and cancer risk factors recognised, help?seeking barriers endorsed and cancer communication. Communication self?efficacy and intervention fidelity were also assessed. Results: Regression models showed significant differences in the number of cancer warning signs and risk factors recognised between intervention and control groups. In intervention schools, the greatest increases in recognition of cancer warning signs at 6?month follow?up were for unexplained weight loss (from 44.2% to 62.0%) and change in the appearance of a mole (from 46.3% to 70.7%), up by 17.8% and 24.4%, respectively.

8155441,Asia,Primary/Elementary,Behaviour and Social Wellbeing,"Childhood internalizing problems such as anxiety and depression can have serious personal, familial and societal repercussions, including drug and alcohol abuse, delinquency, unplanned pregnancy, and even suicide. There is little research on mindfulness interventions for children with clinical levels of internalizing problems, and school-based mindfulness research with children has focused on non-clinical groups. We employed a two-stage screening and intervention procedure to evaluate an in-school mindfulness-based cognitive intervention for Hong Kong children with subclinical internalizing difficulties. Ninety-three fourth to sixth graders were screened, and twenty students (age 9-13, median age 10) highest among their peers on internalizing problems, but lowest on externalizing problems, participated in a 9-week group mindfulness-based intervention. We employed a two-phase open trial design, with random assignment to an immediate intervention group or wait-list control group. In single-trial analysis, one-tailed dependent sample t-tests showed significant decreases in both worry and in symptoms of panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, generalized anxiety and overall internalizing problems. In a randomized controlled trial analysis, the immediate intervention group evidenced larger but nonsignificant reductions on almost all measures. Eighty-five percent of the participants rated the program as helpful, and 65-80 % reported improvement in handling emotions and interpersonal relationships at post-treatment, with some treatment gains maintained at 3-month follow-up.

Setting: Primary schools, high social deprivation, Ireland/Northern Ireland. Design: Cluster randomised controlled trial. Method: A total of 383, 7- to 8-year-old children were invited to participate and randomly allocated into intervention and control conditions. Baseline and 12-month follow-up assessments of COHRQoL, self-esteem, toothbrushing-fluoride toothpaste knowledge and unstimulated saliva samples were made. An 18-hour post-brushing, saliva fluoride concentration was used to assess toothbrushing with fluoride toothpaste (behaviour). The data were entered onto SPSSv22. Structural equation modelling was applied using AMOSv22 to test for the role of health-learning capacity (baseline self-esteem and COHRQoL) and simultaneous effects of Winning Smiles upon knowledge, behaviour and COHRQoL (at follow-up). Results: A total of 238 children participated at baseline and follow-up.

3030964,Rest of Europe,Primary/Elementary,Behaviour and Social Wellbeing,"Objective: In this randomized controlled trial, we investigated the effectiveness of a school-based targeted intervention program for disruptive behavior. A child-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) program was introduced at schools in disadvantaged settings and with active teacher support (ATS) versus educational teacher support (ETS) (CBT + ATS vs. CBT + ETS). Method: Screening (n = 1,929) and assessment (n = 224) led to the inclusion of 173 children ages 8-12 years from 17 elementary schools. Most of the children were boys (n = 136, 79%) of low or low-to-middle class socioeconomic status (87%); the sample was ethnically diverse (63% of non-Western origin). Children received CBT + ATS (n = 29) or CBT + ETS (n = 41) or were entered into a waitlist control condition (n = 103) to be treated afterward (CBT + ATS, n = 39, and CBT + ETS, n = 64). Effect sizes (ES), clinical significance (reliable change), and the results of multilevel modeling are reported. Results: Ninety-seven percent of children completed treatment. Teachers and parents reported positive posttreatment effects (mean ES =.31) for CBT compared with the waitlist control condition on disruptive behavior. Multilevel modeling showed similar results. Clinical significance was modest. Changes had remained stable or had increased at 3-months follow-up (mean ES =.39). No consistent effect of teacher condition was found at posttreatment; however, at follow-up, children who received ETS fared significantly better. Conclusions: This study shows that a school-based CBT program is beneficial for difficult-to-reach children with disruptive behavior: The completion rate was remarkably high, ESs (mean ES =.31) matched those of previous studies with targeted intervention, and effects were maintained or had increased at follow-up. 2013 American Psychological Association.",School-based intervention for childhood disruptive behavior in disadvantaged settings: A randomized controlled trial with and without active teacher support,https://www.google.com/search?q=School-based+intervention+for+childhood+disruptive+behavior+in+disadvantaged+settings:+A+randomized+controlled+trial+with+and+without+active+teacher+support,2013,Targeted,Mixture,Between Half and Full Term,None,None,Clustered,173,16,Yes,Some Sub-Groups Reported,At Least Some Follow-Up,Yes,"Yes, Limited","Yes, Descriptive Theory of Change",No,Rest of Europe Primary/Elementary Behaviour and Social Wellbeing

Previous research has found significant mental health problems among children exposed to major disasters. School-based universal interventions have shown promise in alleviating distress and posttraumatic symptomatology in children and adolescents. This study evaluated the efficacy of a school-based intervention in reducing stress-related symptomatology among Sri Lankan children exposed to the tsunami. Methods: In a quasi-randomized controlled trial 166 elementary school students (ages 9ï¿½15) with significant levels of tsunami exposure and previous traumatic background were randomly assigned to a 12-session structured program ï¿½ERASE Stress Sri Lankaï¿½ (ES-SL) or to a waiting list (WL) religious class control group.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We assessed psychiatric symptoms using the Child Posttraumatic Stress Scale, Depression Self-Rating Scale, the Self-Report for Anxiety Related Disorders 5-item version, and the Children's Hope Scale, and assessed function impairment as treatment outcomes using standardized symptom checklists and locally developed rating scales. RESULTS: Correcting for clustering of participants within schools, we found significantly more improvement in posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms (mean change difference, 2.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02 to 4.53) and maintained hope (mean change difference, -2.21; 95% CI, -3.52 to -0.91) in the treatment group than in the wait-listed group. Changes in traumatic idioms (stress-related physical symptoms) (mean change difference, 0.50; 95% CI, -0.12 to 1.11), depressive symptoms (mean change difference, 0.70; 95% CI, -0.08 to 1.49), anxiety (mean change difference, 0.12; 95% CI, -0.31 to 0.56), and functioning (mean change difference, 0.52; 95% CI, -0.43 to 1.46) were not different between the treatment and wait-listed groups. CONCLUSIONS: In this study of children in violence-affected communities, a school-based intervention reduced posttraumatic stress symptoms and helped maintain hope, but did not reduce traumatic-stress related symptoms, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, or functional impairment.

3031170,Africa,College/University,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"Background: Armed conflicts are associated with a wide range of impacts on the mental health of children and adolescents. We evaluated the effectiveness of a school-based intervention aimed at reducing symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety (treatment aim); and improving a sense of hope and functioning (preventive aim). Methods: We conducted a cluster randomized trial with 329 children in war-affected Burundi (aged 8 to 17 (mean 12.29 years, standard deviation 1.61); 48% girls). One group of children (n = 153) participated in a 15-session school-based intervention implemented by para-professionals, and the remaining 176 children formed a waitlist control condition. Outcomes were measured before, one week after, and three months after the intervention. Results: No main effects of the intervention were identified. However, longitudinal growth curve analyses showed six favorable and two unfavorable differences in trajectories between study conditions in interaction with several moderators. Children in the intervention condition living in larger households showed decreases on depressive symptoms and function impairment, and those living with both parents showed decreases on posttraumatic stress disorder and depressive symptoms. The groups of children in the waitlist condition showed increases in depressive symptoms. In addition, younger children and those with low levels of exposure to traumatic events in the intervention condition showed improvements on hope. Children in the waitlist condition who lived on their original or newly bought land showed improvements in hope and function impairment, whereas children in the intervention condition showed deterioration on these outcomes. Conclusions: Given inconsistent effects across studies, findings do not support this school-based intervention as a treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder and depressive symptoms in conflict-affected children. The intervention appears to have more consistent preventive benefits, but these effects are contingent upon individual (for example, age, gender) and contextual (for example, family functioning, state of conflict, displacement) variables. Results suggest the potential benefit of school-based preventive interventions particularly in post-conflict settings.

3031198,USA/Canada,Middle/High School,Behaviour and Social Wellbeing,"Objectives: Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) has been shown to improve mental health and reduce stress in a variety of adult populations. Here, we explore the effects of a school-based MBSR program for young urban males. Participants and methods: In fall 2009, 7th and 8th graders at a small school for low-income urban boys were randomly assigned to 12-session programs of MBSR or health education (Healthy Topics-HT). Data were collected at baseline, post-program, and three-month follow-up on psychological functioning; sleep; and salivary cortisol, a physiologic measure of stress. Results: Forty-one (22 MBSR and 19 HT) of the 42 eligible boys participated, of whom 95% were African American, with a mean age of 12.5. years. Following the programs, MBSR boys had less anxiety (p = 0.01), less rumination (p = 0.02), and showed a trend for less negative coping (p = 0.06) than HT boys. Comparing baseline with post-program, cortisol levels increased during the academic terms for HT participants at a trend level (p = 0.07) but remained constant for MBSR participants (p = 0.33). Conclusions: In this study, MBSR participants showed less anxiety, improved coping, and a possible attenuation of cortisol response to academic stress, when compared with HT participants. These results suggest that MBSR improves psychological functioning among urban male youth. 2013 Elsevier Inc.",School-based mindfulness instruction for urban male youth: A small randomized controlled trial,https://www.google.com/search?q=School-based+mindfulness+instruction+for+urban+male+youth:+A+small+randomized+controlled+trial,2013,Targeted,External Educators,More than One Term,Physical Health and Wellbeing,None,Single,41,NA,Yes,Whole Sample Only,At Least Some Follow-Up,Yes,"Yes, Fairly Well",No,Yes,USA/Canada Middle/High School Behaviour and Social Wellbeing

For each of 12 pairs of parallel classes with students (age range 13ï¿½20) from five schools (N = 408), one class was randomly assigned to the mindfulness condition and one class to the control condition. Students in the mindfulness group completed depression assessments (the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales) prior to and immediately following the intervention and 6 months after the intervention. Control students completed the questionnaire at the same times as those in the mindfulness group. Hierarchical linear modeling showed that the mindfulness intervention showed significantly greater reductions (and greater clinically significant change) in depression compared with the control group at the 6-month follow-up.

3031442,Australia/New Zealand,Middle/High School,Behaviour and Social Wellbeing,"Background: Depressive disorders are experienced by 3-5% of the adolescent population at any point of time. They adversely affect adolescent development in a range of areas and greatly increase risk for suicide. The present study investigated the effectiveness of a universal intervention designed to reduce depressive symptoms among students commencing high school. Methods: Twenty-five pairs of secondary schools matched on socio-economic status were randomly assigned to either an intervention or a comparison group (n = 5,634 Year 8 students). The intervention extended over a 3-year period and utilised a comprehensive classroom curriculum programme, enhancements to the school climate, improvements in care pathways, and community forums. A range of measures completed by students, average age at baseline = 13.1 years (SD = 0.5), and teachers was used to assess changes in depressive symptoms, risk and protective factors relevant to depression, and the quality of the school environment. Results: Changes in the level of depressive symptoms and in the levels of risk and protective factors experienced by students in the two groups did not differ significantly over the 3 years of the study. Furthermore, statistically significant differences in the ratings of school climate across this time period were found only for staff-rated assessments. Conclusions: Despite using an extensive, structured programme, based on best evidence to increase protective factors and reduce risk factors at the individual and school levels, the intervention did not reduce levels of depressive symptoms among participating adolescents. The results draw attention to the difficulties faced when implementing large-scale, school-based, universal preventive interventions. These include the need to develop methods to effectively train teachers across large geographical regions to deliver new interventions with fidelity, the difficulty of engaging young adolescents with prevention programmes, and the long period of time required to implement policy and practice changes at 'whole-school' levels.",School-Based Prevention of Depression: A Randomised Controlled Study of the 'beyondblue' Schools Research Initiative,https://www.google.com/search?q=School-Based+Prevention+of+Depression:+A+Randomised+Controlled+Study+of+the+'beyondblue'+Schools+Research+Initiative,2010,Universal,Regular Teachers/Lecturers,Full Academic Year or Longer,none,none,Clustered,5634,50,No,Some Sub-Groups Reported,At Least Some Follow-Up,Yes,"Yes, Fairly Well","Yes, Descriptive Theory of Change",Yes,Australia/New Zealand Middle/High School Behaviour and Social Wellbeing

DESIGN: A cluster-randomized, controlled design with assessments of self-reported sexual behavior collected before intervention and 3, 6, and 12 months after intervention. SETTING: Primary schools in a large, black township and a neighboring rural settlement in Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. PARTICIPANTS: Nine of 17 matched pairs of schools were randomly selected. Sixth-grade students with parent or guardian consent were eligible. INTERVENTIONS: Two 6-session interventions based on behavior-change theories and qualitative research. The HIV/STD risk-reduction intervention targeted sexual risk behaviors; the attention-matched health promotion control intervention targeted health issues unrelated to sexual behavior. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was self report of unprotected vaginal intercourse in the previous 3 months averaged over the 3 follow-ups. Secondary outcomes were other sexual behaviors. RESULTS: A total of 1057 (94.5%) of 1118 eligible students (mean age,ï¿½12.4 years) participated, with 96.7% retained at the 12-month follow-up. Generalized estimating equation analyses adjusted for clustering from 18 schools revealed that, averaged over the 3 follow-ups, a significantly smaller percentage of HIV/STD risk-reduction intervention participants reported having unprotected vaginal intercourse (odds ratio [OR],ï¿½0.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.30-0.85), vaginal intercourse (OR,ï¿½0.62; 95% CI, 0.42-0.94), and multiple sexual partners (OR,ï¿½0.50; 95% CI, 0.28-0.89), when adjusted for baseline prevalences, compared with health-promotion control participants.

3031090,Asia,Primary/Elementary,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"BACKGROUND: Oral health education (OHE) in schools has largely been imparted by dental professionals. Considering the substantial cost of this expert-led approach, the strategies relying on teachers, peer-leaders and learners themselves have also been utilized. However the evidence for comparative effectiveness of these strategies is lacking in the dental literature. The present study was conducted to compare the effectiveness of dentist-led, teacher-led, peer-led and self-learning strategies of oral health education. METHODS: A two-year cluster randomized controlled trial following a parallel design was conducted. It involved five groups of adolescents aged 10-11 years at the start of the study. The trial involved process as well as four outcome evaluations. The present paper discusses the findings of the study pertaining to the baseline and final outcome evaluation, both comprising of a self-administered questionnaire, a structured interview and clinical oral examination. The data were analyzed using Generalized Estimating Equations. RESULTS: All the three educator-led strategies of OHE had statistically higher mean oral health knowledge (OHK), oral health behavior (OHB), oral hygiene status (OHS) and combined knowledge, behavior and oral hygiene status (KBS) scores than the self-learning and control groups (p<0.001). The mean OHK, OHS and KBS scores of the three educator-led strategies did not differ significantly. The peer-led strategy was, however, found to have a significantly better OHB score than the respective score of the teacher-led strategy (p<0.05). The self-learning group had significantly higher OHB score than the control group (p<0.05) but the OHK, OHS and KBS scores of the two groups were not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: The dentist-led, teacher-led and peer-led strategies of oral health education are equally effective in improving the oral health knowledge and oral hygiene status of adolescents. The peer-led strategy, however, is almost as effective as the dentist-led strategy and comparatively more effective than the teacher-led and self-learning strategies in improving their oral health behavior.

3030845,Rest of Europe,Middle/High School,Other School Subjects,"BACKGROUND: Suicidal behaviours in adolescents are a major public health problem and evidence-based prevention programmes are greatly needed. We aimed to investigate the efficacy of school-based preventive interventions of suicidal behaviours. METHODS: The Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) study is a multicentre, cluster-randomised controlled trial. The SEYLE sample consisted of 11,110 adolescent pupils, median age 15 years (IQR 14-15), recruited from 168 schools in ten European Union countries. We randomly assigned the schools to one of three interventions or a control group. The interventions were: (1) Question, Persuade, and Refer (QPR), a gatekeeper training module targeting teachers and other school personnel, (2) the Youth Aware of Mental Health Programme (YAM) targeting pupils, and (3) screening by professionals (ProfScreen) with referral of at-risk pupils. Each school was randomly assigned by random number generator to participate in one intervention (or control) group only and was unaware of the interventions undertaken in the other three trial groups. The primary outcome measure was the number of suicide attempt(s) made by 3 month and 12 month follow-up. Analysis included all pupils with data available at each timepoint, excluding those who had ever attempted suicide or who had shown severe suicidal ideation during the 2 weeks before baseline. This study is registered with the German Clinical Trials Registry, number DRKS00000214. FINDINGS: Between Nov 1, 2009, and Dec 14, 2010, 168 schools (11,110 pupils) were randomly assigned to interventions (40 schools [2692 pupils] to QPR, 45 [2721] YAM, 43 [2764] ProfScreen, and 40 [2933] control). No significant differences between intervention groups and the control group were recorded at the 3 month follow-up. At the 12 month follow-up, YAM was associated with a significant reduction of incident suicide attempts (odds ratios [OR] 0ï¿½45, 95% CI 0ï¿½24-0ï¿½85; p=0ï¿½014) and severe suicidal ideation (0ï¿½50, 0ï¿½27-0ï¿½92; p=0ï¿½025), compared with the control group. 14 pupils (0ï¿½70%) reported incident suicide attempts at the 12 month follow-up in the YAM versus 34 (1ï¿½51%) in the control group, and 15 pupils (0ï¿½75%) reported incident severe suicidal ideation in the YAM group versus 31 (1ï¿½37%) in the control group. No participants completed suicide during the study period. INTERPRETATION: YAM was effective in reducing the number of suicide attempts and severe suicidal ideation in school-based adolescents. These findings underline the benefit of this universal suicide preventive intervention in schools.

However not much is known about the health of young adolescent girls (11-14 years) in India who enter puberty with substantial nutritional and health deficits. Identifying early adolescence as a 'gateway' moment, the Saloni pilot study is arandomized control trial (RCT) to improve nutrition, hygiene and reproductive health behaviors in 30 schools in rural Uttar Pradesh (UP), India. A prevention model that includes Sadharanikaran, an ancient Indian theory of communication, guided the development of the intervention.The Saloni strategy includes a 10 session in-school intervention based on compassion, self efficacy, emotional well being, peer and parental support, packaged in the form of short, easy-to-use instructional modules. A diary designed to engage adolescent girls is provided to each girl.The cluster RCT was conducted from January 2010 to October 2011 with adolescent girls (11-14 years of age) in Hardoi district. The trial is a two-level, nested RCT with the unit of randomization being the block with 15 schools in the intervention arm and 15 schools in the control arm.

5132587,USA/Canada,College/University,Numeracy/Maths,"Many students enter the Canadian college system with insufficient mathematical ability and leave the system with little improvement. Those students who enter with poor mathematics ability typically take a developmental mathematics course as their first and possibly only mathematics course. The educational experiences that comprise a developmental mathematics course vary widely and are, too often, ineffective at improving students’ ability. This trend is concerning, since low mathematics ability is known to be related to lower rates of success in subsequent courses. To date, little attention has been paid to the selection of an instructional approach to consistently apply across developmental mathematics courses. Prior research suggests that an appropriate instructional method would involve explicit instruction and practising mathematical procedures linked to a mathematical concept. This study reports on a randomized field trial of a developmental mathematics approach at a college in Ontario, Canada. The new approach is an adaptation of the JUMP Math program, an explicit instruction method designed for primary and secondary school curriculae, to the college learning environment. In this study, a subset of courses was assigned to JUMP Math and the remainder was taught in the same style as in the previous years. We found consistent, modest improvement in the JUMP Math sections compared to the non-JUMP sections, after accounting for potential covariates. The findings from this randomized field trial, along with prior research on effective education for developmental mathematics students, suggest that JUMP Math is a promising way to improve college student outcomes.

8154944,Rest of Europe,College/University,Professional Training,"Purpose: Learning curves for minimally invasive surgery are prolonged since psychomotor skills and visuospatial orientation differ from open surgery and must be learned. This study explored potential advantages of sequential learning of psychomotor and visuospatial skills for laparoscopic suturing and knot tying compared to simultaneous learning. Methods: Laparoscopy-naive medical students were randomized into a sequential learning group (SEQ) or a simultaneous learning group (SIM). SEQ (n = 28) trained on a shoebox with direct 3D view before proceeding on a box trainer with 2D laparoscopic view. SIM (n = 25) trained solely on a box trainer with 2D laparoscopic view. Training time and number of attempts needed were recorded until a clearly defined proficiency level was reached. Results: Groups were not different in total training time (SEQ 5868.7 +/- 2857.2 s; SIM 5647.1 +/- 2244.8 s; p = 0.754) and number of attempts to achieve proficiency in their training (SEQ 44.0 +/- 17.7; SIM 36.8 +/- 15.6; p = 0.123). SEQ needed less training time on the box trainer with 2D laparoscopic view than did SIM (SEQ 4170.9 +/- 2350.8 s; SIM 5647.1 +/- 2244.8 s; p = 0.024), while the number of attempts here was not different (SEQ 29.9 +/- 14.1; SIM 36.8 +/- 15.6; p = 0.097). SEQ was faster in the first attempts on the shoebox (281.9 +/- 113.1 s) and box trainer (270.4 +/- 133.1 s) compared to the first attempt of SIM on the box trainer (579.4 +/- 323.8 s) (p < 0.001). Conclusion: In the present study, SEQ was faster than SIM at the beginning of the learning curve. SEQ did not reduce the total training time needed to reach an ambitious proficiency level. However, SEQ needed less training on the box trainer; thus, laparoscopic experience can be gained to a certain extent with a simple shoebox.

3030605,Asia,College/University,Professional Training,"; The purpose of this study was to explore the long term effect of a service learning project on medical and nursing studentsï¿½ knowledge in aging and their attitudes toward older adults. A total of 124 students were recruited and then randomized to intervention group (IG) and control group (CG). A pre-and-post-intervention design measured studentsï¿½ knowledge in aging (using modified Palmoreï¿½s Fact on Aging Quiz) and attitudes toward older adults (using Koganï¿½s Old People Scale). A total of 103 students completed all the activities and questionnaires. After the intervention, there were significant differences between the IG and CG on Palmoreï¿½s mental health (MH) (P = .04), Palmoreï¿½s total score (P = .02) and Koganï¿½s negative attitudes toward older adults (P = .001). All students increased their positive attitude toward older adults after the intervention. However, both the IG and CG showed a decrease in positive attitudes 1 month after the interventon, and such decrease varied, depending on the programme which students attended. The current study showed that the 10-week service learning activities significantly increased medical and nursing studentsï¿½ overall knowledge of aging and their understanding of mental health needs in old age, and reduced their negative attitudes toward older adults. However, the effect is not long-lasting. On the other hand, its effect on positive attitudes toward older adults cannot be concluded.

3031115,USA/Canada,Middle/High School,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy of two, theory-based, multimedia, middle school sexual education programs in delaying sexual initiation. Methods: Three-armed, randomized controlled trial comprising 15 urban middle schools; 1,258 predominantly African American and Hispanic seventh grade students followed into ninth grade. Both programs included group and individualized, computer-based activities addressing psychosocial variables. The risk avoidance (RA) program met federal abstinence education guidelines; the risk reduction (RR) program emphasized abstinence and included computer-based condom skills-training. The primary outcome assessed program impact on delayed sexual initiation; secondary outcomes assessed other sexual behaviors and psychosocial outcomes. Results: Participants were 59.8% females (mean age: 12.6 years). Relative to controls, the RR program delayed any type of sexual initiation (oral, vaginal, or anal sex) in the overall sample (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]:.65, 95% CI:.54.77), among females (AOR:.43, 95% CI:.31.60), and among African Americans (AOR:.38, 95% CI:.18.79). RR students also reduced unprotected sex at last intercourse (AOR:.67, 95% CI:.47.96), frequency of anal sex in the past 3 months (AOR:.53, 95% CI:.33.84), and unprotected vaginal sex (AOR:.59, 95% CI:.36.95). The RA program delayed any sexual initiation among Hispanics (AOR:.40, 95% CI:.19.86), reduced unprotected sex at last intercourse (AOR:.70, 95% CI:.52.93), but increased the number of recent vaginal sex partners (AOR: 1.69, 95% CI: 1.012.82).

METHODS: 64 Kindergartens in 4 Bavarian regions were randomly assigned as intervention or controls in a 2:1 ratio. Samples of 1318 and 1340 children examined in the school entrance health examination at 5.7+/-2.6 and 17.6+/-2.3 months (mean+/-standard deviation for first and second sample) after the start of the program were analysed. MEASUREMENTS: Main outcome measures were the prevalence of high fruit and vegetable consumption, low consumption of high caloric drinks assessed in parental questionnaires, overweight and obesity, and secondary, further dietary habits and results of motoric testing. RESULTS: The program led to an increased proportion of children with high fruit and vegetable consumption already after 6 months, which was sustainable with adjusted odds ratios of 1.59 (1.26: 2.01) and 1.48 (1.08: 2.03) after 18 months. Subgroup analyses by gender, overweight and parental education, performed in order to assess consistency of effects, showed similar results. Prevalence of overweight and obesity as well as motoric testing results were not statistically different between intervention and control groups.

The Experience Corps Baltimore (Maryland) program places a critical mass of older adult volunteers, serving 15 hours or more per week, in public schools to perform meaningful and important roles to improve the educational outcomes of children and the health and well-being of the volunteers. This article reports on the preliminary impact of the program on children in grades K-3. A total of 1,194 children in grades K-3 from six urban elementary schools participated in this pilot trial. At follow-up, third grade children whose schools were randomly selected for the program had significantly higher scores on a standardized reading test than children in the control schools, and there was a nonsignificant trend for improvement in alphabet recognition and vocabulary ability among kindergarten children in the program. Office referrals for classroom misbehavior decreased by about half in the Experience Corps schools, but remained the same in the control schools. Teachers had somewhat more favorable attitudes toward senior volunteers as a result of having older volunteers in the classroom, although the difference between the intervention and control schools was not statistically significant.

3031207,Multiple,College/University,Professional Training,"OBJECTIVE: This study was performed to determine whether students who are trained in developing a personal formulary become more competent in rational prescribing than students who have only learned to use existing formularies. METHODS: This was a multicentre, randomised, controlled study conducted in eight universities in India, Indonesia, the Netherlands, the Russian Federation, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain and Yemen. Five hundred and eighty-three medical students were randomised into three groups: the personal formulary group (PF; 94), the existing formulary group (EF; 98) and the control group (C; 191). The PF group was taught how to develop and use a personal formulary, whereas e the EF group was taught how to review and use an existing formulary. The C group received no additional training and participated only in the tests. Student's prescribing skills were measured by scoring their treatment plans for written patient cases. RESULTS: The mean PF group score increased by 23% compared with 19% for the EF group (p < 0.05) and 6% for controls (p < 0.05). The positive effect of PF training was only significant in universities that had a mainly classic curriculum. CONCLUSION: Training in development and use of a personal formulary was particularly effective in universities with a classic curriculum and with traditional pharmacology teaching. In universities with a general problem-based curriculum, pharmacotherapy teaching can be based on either existing or personal formularies.","Should medical students learn to develop a personal formulary?

Aim: This study assessed whether financial incentives can motivate students to acquire electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation skills. Methods: Students enrolled for a cardio-respiratory teaching module (n?=?121) were randomised to an intervention (financial incentive) or a control (book voucher raffle) condition. All students took three validated exams of ECG interpretation skills (at module entry, module exit and seven weeks later). Only the exit exam was financially incentivised in the intervention group. The primary outcome was the proportion of students who correctly identified =60% of clinically important diagnoses in the exit exam. Results: Financial incentives more than doubled the odds of correctly identifying =60% of diagnoses in the exit exam (adjusted odds ratio 2.44, 95% confidence interval 1.05ï¿½5.67) and significantly increased student learning time. However, there was no significant effect on performance levels in the retention exam. Conclusions: Financial incentives increase reported learning time and examination results in the short-term.

Methods: A parallel, two-arm randomized controlled pilot trial was conducted. High school students (13 to 16 years) were randomly allocated to either a classroom-based sleep education program intervention (n = 15) or to a usual curriculum control group (n = 14). The sleep education program involved four 50-minute classroom-based education sessions with interactive groups. Students completed a 7-day sleep diary, a sleep questionnaire (including sleep hygiene, knowledge and problems) at baseline, post-intervention (4 weeks) and 10 weeks follow-up. Results: An overall treatment effect was observed for weekend sleep duration (F1,24 = 5.21, p = 0.03). Participants in the intervention group slept longer during weekend nights at 5 weeks (1:37 h:min, p = 0.01) and 10 weeks: (1:32 h:min, p = 0.03) compared to those in the control group. No differences were found between groups for sleep duration on weekday nights. No significant differences were observed between groups for any of the secondary outcomes (sleep hygiene, sleep problems, or sleep knowledge). Conclusions: A sleep education program appears to increase weekend sleep duration in the short term.

We assessed the efficacy of a school-based nurse-directed ST intervention among rural high school males. METHODS: Study high schools were randomly selected from a public high school list of California rural counties. Consenting high schools were stratified by school size and randomly assigned within strata to intervention or no-intervention groups. After gaining parental consent, male students completed baseline and 1-year follow-up questionnaires. The intervention included peer-led educational sessions and an oral exam by the school nurse who also provided brief tobacco cessation counseling. We used binary generalized estimating equation (GEE) models accounting for clustering within schools to test no difference between groups after adjusting for year in high school using both completers only and multiple imputation for those lost to follow-up. Subgroup analyses assessed Baseline Factor x Group interaction in GEE models. RESULTS: Twenty-one rural counties (72%), 41 randomly selected high schools (56%), and 4,731 male students (50%) participated with 65% retention. Nonsmoking ST users in the intervention group were significantly more likely to stop using ST at follow-up than those in the no-intervention group; there was no intervention effect among baseline ST users who also smoked. A higher percentage of baseline nonsmoking ST users reported smoking at follow-up than baseline non-ST-using smokers who reported using ST. DISCUSSION: A school-based nurse-directed ST cessation program was efficacious among rural nonsmoking ST-using high school males. The potential program reach holds significant public health value.

DESIGN: A randomised controlled trial comparing cessation rates among students in a behavioural cessation programme and those receiving self help materials only. SETTING: Eighteen schools in the Memphis, Tennessee area. SUBJECTS: Two hundred and sixty one adolescent cigarette smokers (166 male, 95 female) averaging 15.8 years of age. INTERVENTION: Students assigned to the intervention received a four session behavioural treatment programme administered individually by a health educator. In addition, these students received stage matched intervention in brief phone calls monthly until the one year follow up. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Self reported and biochemically verified smoking cessation at post-test and 12 month follow up. RESULTS: Recruiting students who were caught smoking at school proved to be highly successful. Participants rated the programme favourably, and retention rates were high. Although treated participants improved more in tobacco related knowledge relative to controls (p = 0.002), there were no group differences in changes in attitudes toward smoking. In addition, treated and control participants demonstrated no significant differences in cessation rates both at post-test and follow up. Comparisons between self reported cessation rates and those obtained under bogus pipeline conditions or with biochemical verification suggested significant falsification of cessation among participants.

For further analysis, we now decided to run a randomized controlled longitudinal trial. Participating students at Coburg University were randomized into an intervention (n = 24) or a waitlist control group (n = 19). The intervention group completed 3 sets (pre/post/follow-up) and the control group 2 sets (pre/post) of self-administered questionnaires. The questionnaires included: SF-12 Health Survey, Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Sense of Coherence (SOC-L9), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) concerning stress, and the Stress Warning Signs (SWS) scale. Randomly selected participants of the intervention group were also queried in qualitative interviews. The intervention consisted of an 8 week stress management group program (mind-body medical stress reduction - MBMSR). Follow-up measures were taken after 6 months. Virtually, no drop-out occurred. Our study showed significant effects in the intervention group concerning SF-12 Mental Component Scale (p = 0.05), SF-12 Physical Component Scale (p = 0.001), VAS (in general, p = 0.001) and SWS (emotional reactions, p <0.001), underlined by qualitative results, which showed a higher quality of life. The effectiveness of an MBMSR program in a group of supposedly healthy students could be demonstrated.

3031366,NA,NA,NA,"PURPOSE: Ultrasound is a widely used diagnostic tool. In medical education, it can be used to teach sonographic anatomy as well as the basics of ultrasound diagnostics. Some medical schools have begun implementing student tutor-led teaching sessions in sonographic abdominal anatomy in order to meet the growing demand in ultrasound teaching. However, while this teaching concept has proven to be feasible and well accepted, there is limited data regarding its effectiveness. We investigated whether student tutors teach sonographic anatomy as effectively as faculty staff sonographers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 50 medical students were randomly assigned to one of two groups. 46 of these could be included in the analysis. One group was taught by student tutors (ST) and the other by a faculty staff sonographer (FS). Using a pre/post-test design, students were required to locate and label 15 different abdominal structures. They printed out three pictures in three minutes and subsequently labeled the structures they were able to identify. The pictures were then rated by two blinded faculty staff sonographers. A mean difference of one point in the improvement of correctly identified abdominal structures between the pre-test and post-test among the two groups was regarded as equivalent. RESULTS: In the pre-test, the ST (FS) correctly identified 1.6ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½1.0 (2.0ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½1.1) structures.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2010-14546-004). Background: Population-based studies directed at promoting physical activity in youth have shown limited success in obesity prevention. Objective: To assess whether an intervention integrating environmental changes to induce sustained changes in physical activity, prevents overweight in adolescents. Design: Four-year randomized trial started in 2002 in eight middle schools of Eastern France. The intervention, randomized at school level, was designed to promote physical activity by changing attitudes through debates and attractive activities, and by providing social support and environmental changes encouraging physical activity. Subjects: Nine hundred and fifty four 12-year-old six-graders. Measurements: Body mass index (BMI), body composition, physical activity by questionnaire, plasma lipids and glucose, insulin resistance. Results: Intervention students had a lower increase in BMI (P=0.01) and age- and gender-adjusted BMI (P<0.02) over time than controls. The differences across groups of the age- and gender-adjusted BMI changes (95% confidence interval (CI)) were &minus;0.29 (&minus;0.51; &minus;0.07) kg/m2 at 3 years, &minus;0.25 (&minus;0.51; 0.01) kg/m2 at 4 years. An interaction with baseline weight status was noted. The intervention had a significant effect throughout the study in initially non-overweight adolescents (&minus;0.36 (&minus;0.60;&minus;0.11) kg/m2 for adjusted BMI at 4 years), corresponding to a lower increase in fat mass index (P<0.001). In initially overweight adolescents, the differences observed across groups at 2 years (ï¿½0.40 (&minus;0.94; 0.13) kg/m2 for adjusted BMI) did not persist over time. At 4 years, 4.2% of the initially non-overweight adolescents were overweight in the intervention schools, 9.8% in the controls (odds ratio=0.41 (0.22; 0.75); P<0.01). Independent of initial weight status, compared with controls, intervention adolescents had an increase in supervised physical activity (P<0.0001), a decrease of TV/video viewing (P<0.01) and an increase of high-density cholesterol concentrations (P<0.0001).

Although the use of mobile communication devices by health care professionals has dramatically increased, scientific data on their efficacy in medical education and clinical training is very limited. Aim: We hypothesized that the use of our specifically developed training and test software system on wireless enabled tablet PCs in conjunction with an online course management system enhances the learning experiences of medical students as well as gastroenterology residents and fellows. Methods: Eighty participants were recruited, phenotyped and randomized to either the tablet or controls groups, respectively. The test group could take advantage of their tablet computer based resources (i.e. eBooks, eJournals, digital animations and videos, access to online course management system (Moddle), educational software programs and podcasts from leading medical publishers including the AGA Institute, ASGE and ACP), while the control group had access to all conventional resources (i.e. library, books, journals) for the entire duration their four month rotation. Their performance was statistically analyzed and compared by administration of random generator selected, thematically equally distributed questions from the Medical Knowledge Self-Assessment Program MKSAP (n=215) and Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Self-Assessment Program GESAP (n=200) at the beginning and the end of their rotation. The potential impact of confounding variables on test scores and correlation between individual and objectively assessed knowledge was investigated. Results: Data of 55 participants (tablet n=24, 50% male; controls, n=31, 25.8% male; median age 28 years) were evaluable. Median differences in score distribution at the beginning and the end of the rotation were significantly different in the tablet (MKSAP p = 0.002, CI 95%; GESAP p = 0.006, CI 95%), but not the control (MKSAP p = 0.233, CI 95%; GESAP p = 0.096, CI 95%) group, respectively. Age, gender, clinical experience abroad, affinity to computers, final medical school exam score (in graduated participants), additional Ph.D. degree and training level had no significant impact on these results in both groups. However, MKSAP, but not GESAP score distribution was significantly (p = 0.049, CI 95%) improved in participants with eLearning experience.

METHOD: Adolescents at risk for future depressive disorder by virtue of having elevated depressive symptomatology were selected with a two-stage case-finding procedure. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) was administered to 1,652 students; adolescents with elevated CES-D scores were interviewed with the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children. Subjects with current affective diagnoses were referred to nonexperimental services. The remaining 150 consenting subjects were considered at risk for future depression and randomized to either a 15-session cognitive group prevention intervention or an 'usual care' control condition. Subjects were reassessed for DSM-III-R diagnostic status after the intervention and at 6- and 12-month follow-up points. RESULTS: Survival analyses indicated a significant 12-month advantage for the prevention program, with affective disorder total incidence rates of 14.5% for the active intervention, versus 25.7% for the control condition.

3031890,NA,NA,NA,"Background/Context: One important question to educational research is whether teachers can influence student achievement over time. This question is related to the durability of teacher effects on student achievement in successive grades. The research evidence about teacher effects on student achievement has been somewhat mixed. Some education production function studies seem to suggest that the effects of observed teacher characteristics on student achievement are negligible, while others suggest that they are considerable (Greenwald, Hedges, & Laine, 1996; Hanushek, 1986). Other studies have consistently documented that teachers differ substantially in their effectiveness measured as between-classroom variation in achievement adjusted by student background (Hanushek, 1986; Nye et al., 2004; Rivkin et al., 2005). Thus far, there is no evidence about the persistence of teacher effects in early grades using high quality data from a randomized experiment. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: This study examines the enduring benefits of teacher effects on student achievement in early elementary grades using high quality experimental data from Project STAR. I am interested in determining the persistence of teacher effects in early grades and whether teacher effects remain strong predictors of student achievement or fade over a four-year period for kindergarten through third grade. Research Design: I computed teacher effects as classroom-specific random effects and then I used them as predictors of student achievement in subsequent years. I also examined whether teacher effects persisted through third grade. Multilevel models were used to conduct the analysis. The results suggest that overall teacher effects in early grades are evident through third grade in reading and mathematics achievement. Findings/Results: The findings support the idea that teachers do matter and significantly affect reading and mathematics achievement not only in the current or the following year, but in subsequent years as well. However, the results also show that teacher effects estimates in previous grades are smaller than estimates in later grades. The teacher effects are more pronounced in reading. Conclusions: Students who receive effective teachers at the 85th percentile of the teacher effectiveness distribution in three consecutive grades kindergarten through second grade would experience achievement increases of about one-third of a SD in reading in third grade. These effects are considerable and comparable to achievement increases caused by cumulative effects of small classes in early grades. Such effects in education are important and are nearly one-third of a year's growth in achievement (Hill, Bloom, Black, & Lipsey, 2008).",Teacher Effects in Early Grades: Evidence from a Randomized Study,https://www.google.com/search?q=Teacher+Effects+in+Early+Grades:+Evidence+from+a+Randomized+Study,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA NA NA

Community preschool practices often are not evidence based, and almost none target the prelinguistic core deficits of ASD. This study investigated the effectiveness of public preschool teachers implementing a validated intervention (the Joint Attention and Symbolic Play/Engagement and Regulation intervention; JASP/ER) on a core deficit of autism, initiating joint attention. Method: Sixteen dyads (preschoolers with ASD and the public school teachers who worked in the child's classroom) were randomly assigned to the 6-week JASP/ER intervention or a control group. Results: At the end of the intervention, JASP/ER teachers used more JASP/ER strategies than the control teachers, and JASP/ER preschoolers used more joint attention in their classroom than control children. Additionally, JASP/ER children spent more time in supported engagement and less time in object engagement than control preschoolers on a taped play interaction.

Many studies have demonstrated its efficacy with individual learners, but few studies have addressed its use in a group format. PURPOSE: To assess the educational benefits of group versus individual video review of standardized patient encounters through the evaluations of 4th-year students at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. METHODS: Students (128) who participated in a 7-station, standardized patient, clinical competency exam were randomly assigned to an individual or small group video review of selected segments of these encounters in 2000-2001. Students filled out an anonymous 13-item questionnaire assessing the experience and provided open-ended responses. RESULTS: With both review formats, most students had a positive learning experience (80%), found it less stressful than they expected (67%), and would not have preferred to do the review the other way (84%). Students randomized to individual reviews had a significantly higher level of satisfaction with the amount of time for the session (91% vs. 78%, p < .05) and the amount of feedback they received (95% vs. 79%, p = .01) and were more likely to view the session as a positive learning experience (88% vs. 73%, p < .05). Students in the individual review format were more likely to choose self-assessed weak segments (63% vs. 49%, p = .01).

In this study we attempt to determine if a workshop for final year students at a naturopathic college improved their ability to utilize critical appraisal concepts. METHODS: We assigned 83 Naturopathic Interns to two groups: Group A (n = 47) or Group B (n = 36). We conducted a baseline assessment of all subjects' critical appraisal skills. Group A was assigned to receive a 3(1/2) hour workshop on Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) and Group B received a workshop on bioethics (control intervention). The groups critical appraisal skills were re-evaluated at this time. We then crossed over the intervention so that Group B received the EBM workshop while Group A received the bioethics workshop. Assessment of critical appraisal skills of the two groups was again performed. RESULTS: The students mean scores were similar in Group A (14.8) and Group B (15.0) after Group A had received the intervention and Group B had received the control (p = 0.75).

DESIGN: Non-blind, randomized, controlled study. SETTING: King's College Hospital Medical School, London. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-seven third-year medical students and 11 behaviour therapists. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Seventy-five true/false multiple choice questions relating to (b) below answered at pre- and post-teaching by students and just once by behaviour therapists to obtain 'expert' scores; pre- and post-teaching ratings of interest in behaviour therapy and post-teaching ratings of educational and enjoyment value. EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTIONS: (a) All students had a 20-minute group lecture on basic concepts and historical aspects just before randomization to: (b) 90 min of either solo computer or group face-to-face tutorial teaching. Computer instruction used a short version of 'FearFighter'- a self-help computer system for people suffering from phobias. RESULTS: Solo computer instruction taught exposure therapy principles effectively but improved multiple choice question scores marginally less than did small-group tutorial teaching. Tutorial teaching required 5 times more teacher time but led to knowledge scores that did not differ significantly from those of behaviour therapists. Students clearly rated face-to-face small-group tutorial teaching as more enjoyable. CONCLUSION: The knowledge gain from a solo computer session resembled that from a small-group face-to-face tutorial, and required far less teacher time, but was less enjoyable. Enjoyment might rise if the computer session was group-oriented and aimed at students rather than patients.

Objective: To assess the effect of a multi-modal tobacco dependence treatment curriculum on medical students' counseling skills. Design: A group-randomized controlled trial (2010-2014) included ten U.S. medical schools that were randomized to receive either multi-modal tobacco treatment education (MME) or traditional tobacco treatment education (TE). Setting/Participants: Students from the classes of 2012 and 2014 at ten medical schools participated. Students from the class of 2012 (N = 1345) completed objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs), and 50 % (N = 660) were randomly selected for pre-intervention evaluation. A total of 72.9 % of eligible students (N = 1096) from the class of 2014 completed an OSCE and 69.7 % (N = 1047) completed pre and post surveys. Interventions: The MME included a Web-based course, a role-play classroom demonstration, and a clerkship booster session. Clerkship preceptors in MME schools participated in an academic detailing module and were encouraged to be role models for third-year students. Measurements: The primary outcome was student tobacco treatment skills using the 5As measured by an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) scored on a 33-item behavior checklist. Secondary outcomes were student self-reported skills for performing 5As and pharmacotherapy counseling. Results: Although the difference was not statistically significant, MME students completed more tobacco counseling behaviors on the OSCE checklist (mean 8.7 [SE 0.6] vs. mean 8.0 [SE 0.6], p = 0.52) than TE students. Several of the individual Assist and Arrange items were significantly more likely to have been completed by MME students, including suggesting behavioral strategies (11.8 % vs. 4.5 %, p < 0.001) and providing information regarding quitline (21.0 % vs. 3.8 %, p < 0.001). MME students reported higher self-efficacy for Assist, Arrange, and Pharmacotherapy counseling items (ps <0.05). Limitations: Inclusion of only ten schools limits generalizability.

Experimental evidence of EBM educational interventions from rigorous research studies is limited. The main objective of this study was to assess EBM learning (knowledge, attitudes and self-reported skills) in undergraduate medical students with a randomized controlled trial. METHODS: The educational intervention was a one-semester EBM course in the 5th year of a public medical school in Mexico. The study design was an experimental parallel group randomized controlled trial for the main outcome measures in the 5th year class (M5 EBM vs. M5 non-EBM groups), and quasi-experimental with static-groups comparisons for the 4th year (M4, not yet exposed) and 6th year (M6, exposed 6 months to a year earlier) groups. EBM attitudes, knowledge and self-reported skills were measured using Taylor's questionnaire and a summative exam which comprised of a 100-item multiple-choice question (MCQ) test. RESULTS: 289 Medical students were assessed: M5 EBM=48, M5 non-EBM=47, M4=87, and M6=107. There was a higher reported use of the Cochrane Library and secondary journals in the intervention group (M5 vs. M5 non-EBM). Critical appraisal skills and attitude scores were higher in the intervention group (M5) and in the group of students exposed to EBM instruction during the previous year (M6).

3030778,UK/Ireland,Primary/Elementary,Literacy/English,"Background: Awareness of individual phonemes in words is a late-acquired level of phonological awareness that usually develops in the early school years. It is generally agreed to have a close relationship with early literacy development, but its role in speech change is less well understood. Speech and language therapy for children with speech disorder involves tasks that appear, either implicitly or explicitly, to require a phonemic level of awareness. However, children typically attend for intervention at a pre-school, pre-literate stage, i.e. before they would be expected to have developed the relevant phoneme segmentation and manipulation skills. Aims: To investigate whether it is possible to teach phoneme awareness skills to pre-literate children with speech disorder. Methods & Procedures: In a randomized controlled trial design 42 children with speech disorder, aged 4;0-4;6, were allocated to either a phonological awareness or a language stimulation programme. Children were assessed on four measures of phoneme awareness (alliteration awareness, phoneme isolation, word segmentation and phoneme addition/deletion) immediately before and after the programme and categorized as 'improved' or 'not improved' according to predetermined criteria. Fisher's Exact test was used to compare outcome in the two groups. Outcomes & Results: Significantly more children improved in the phonological awareness group than in the language stimulation group for three out of the four measures (all except alliteration awareness). However, for the two most advanced tasks (segmentation and addition/deletion) only a small minority of children showed improvement. A marked improvement in Phoneme Isolation was made by the majority of children in the phonological awareness group. Conclusions: It is possible to teach some advanced phoneme awareness skills to some pre-literate children. Phoneme Isolation was the most easily learned and is a skill that appears very relevant to speech and language therapy. However, phoneme addition, deletion and word segmentation showed relatively limited improvement and only in a small number of cognitively able and older children. Whereas isolation of word initial consonants appears to be a skill that can be triggered at 4;0-4;6 by relevant activities, most children in the study were not cognitively ready for more advanced, abstract phoneme manipulation tasks. This raises questions about how speech and language therapists should tackle many common errors and the age at which we should aim to develop or draw on phoneme awareness to stimulate speech change.

3030576,USA/Canada,Middle/High School,Numeracy/Maths,"Billions of dollars are spent annually in response to widespread underachievement in areas of math and reading (National Assessment of Education Progress, 2003). Efficacy of these remedial academic programs is often poorly documented and few programs are designed to address individual needs (Kahne, Nagaoka, Brown, O'Brien, Quinn, & Thiede, 2001; Granger, Durlak, Yohalem, & Reisner, 2007). Furthermore, many students do not benefit from these programs due to behavior deficits that impact learning (Granger et al., 2007). The Challenging Horizons Program (CHP) is an evidence-based after-school program that provides an effective framework for engaging students with behavior deficits in learning activities (Langberg, Smith, Bogle, Schmidt, Cole, & Pender, 2006). At the start of this dissertation, the CHP did not have a curriculum targeting students' math performance. This dissertation describes the development of a remedial math intervention delivered within the Challenging Horizons Program designed to be delivered by paraprofessionals with limited training in teaching. To evaluate the curriculum, participants were randomly assigned to either receive the CHP as usual (N = 13) or the CHP plus math intervention 4 days a week (N=13). Outcomes were measured using brief timed assessments of basic math calculation and word problem solving, which showed generally positive effect sizes but low rates of reliable change on a case-by-case basis. No differences in skipping items between the control and treatment groups were observed on the basic calculation weekly assessment measure. Overall, this pilot study suggests that this math intervention can feasibly be delivered by paraprofessionals but some procedural and methodological limitations cloud the interpretation of the results with regard to the efficacy of the math intervention.

5132781,Rest of Europe,College/University,Other School Subjects,"Context Clinical reasoning is an essential skill, the foundations of which should be acquired during undergraduate medical education. Student performance in clinical reasoning can be assessed using key feature examinations. However, within a paradigm of test-enhanced learning, such examinations may also be used to enhance long-term retention of procedural knowledge relevant to clinical reasoning. Objectives This study tested the hypothesis that repeated testing with key feature questions is more effective than repeated case-based learning in fostering clinical reasoning. Methods In this randomised crossover trial, Year 4 medical students attended 10 weekly computer-based seminars during which patient case histories covering general medical conditions were displayed. The presentation format was switched between groups every week. In the control condition, students studied long case narratives. The intervention condition used the same content but augmented case presentation with a sequence of key feature questions. Using a within-subjects design, student performance on intervention and control items was assessed at 13 weeks (exit examination) and 9 months (retention test) after the first day of term. Results A total of 87 of 124 eligible students provided complete data for the longitudinal analysis (response rate: 70.2%). In the retention test, mean ± standard deviation student scores on intervention items were significantly higher than those on control items (56.0 ± 25.8% versus 48.8 ± 24.7%; p < 0.001). The results remained unchanged after accounting for exposure time in a linear regression analysis that also adjusted for sex and general student performance levels. Conclusions This is the first study to demonstrate an effect of test-enhanced learning on clinical reasoning as assessed with key feature questions. In this randomised trial, repeated testing was more effective than repeated case-based learning alone. Curricular implementation of longitudinal key feature testing may considerably enhance student learning outcomes in relevant aspects of clinical medicine.

In a randomized controlled trial with 3 measurement points (pretest, posttest, maintenance), 117 fourth graders either received self-regulatory writing strategies training or were taught writing strategies without self-regulation procedures. Path analyses indicated that relative to teaching writing strategies alone, teaching strategies in tandem with self-regulation procedures improved students' skills of planning and revising stories and thereby enhanced the quality of the resulting stories. Self-regulated learning also enhanced students' knowledge about good writing and strengthened their self-efficacy beliefs, which both had a positive effect on the use of the learned strategies while planning narratives.

Children were randomly assigned to the Good Behavior Game (GBG), a universal classroom-based preventive intervention, or a control condition. Children's acceptance by peers, their number of mutual friends, and their proximity to others were assessed annually through peer ratings. Externalizing behavior was annually rated by teachers. Reductions in children's externalizing behavior and improvements in positive peer relations were found among GBG children, as compared with control-group children. Reductions in externalizing behavior appeared to be partly mediated by the improvements in peer acceptance. This mediating role of peer acceptance was found for boys only. The results suggest that positive peer relations are not just markers, but they are environmental mediators of boys' externalizing behavior development.

Additional programs were created in Dayton and Washington, D.C. and in 1999, the Children's Scholarship Fund, a nationwide school choice scholarship program, provided additional support to these programs. Evaluations of the programs show that in the three cities taken together, the average, overall test performance of African American students who switched from public to private schools was, after 1 year, 3.3 National Percentile Ranking (NPR) points higher than the performance of the control group remaining in the public schools, and after 2 years, the difference was 6.3 NPR points. No statistically significant effects, either positive or negative, were observed for students from other ethnic groups who switched to private schools through these programs. Results for African Americans did not vary significantly by subject matter, but results did vary somewhat by city, with the greatest gains in Washington, D.C. In that city, older students switching to private schools had trouble adapting to their school in the first year, but recovered lost ground and gained substantially by the end of the second year. Evaluation teams plan to explore why the voucher program had positive effects on African American students and no detectable effects on others. (Contains 11 tables.)

METHODS: Eighty-three school clusters (representing school districts) from six metropolitan areas were randomized to treatment (41) or control (42) conditions. Using active consenting procedures, 19,529 seventh graders were enrolled in the 5-year study. Self-administered surveys were completed by the students annually. Trained Drug Abuse Resistance Education (D.A.R.E.) police officers presented TCYL in seventh and ninth grades in treatment schools. Analyses were conducted with data from 17,320 students who completed a baseline survey. Intervention outcomes were measured using self-reported past-month and past-year use of tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana when students were in the 11th grade. RESULTS: Main effect analyses show a negative program effect for use of alcohol and cigarettes and no effect for marijuana use. Subgroup analyses indicated that the negative effect occurred among nonusers at baseline, and mostly among white students of both genders. A positive program effect was found for students who used marijuana at baseline. Two complementary papers explore the relationship of the targeted program mediators to the use of alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana and specifically for students who were substance-free or who used substances at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: The negative impact of the program on baseline nonusers of alcohol and tobacco indicate that TCYL should not be delivered as a universal prevention intervention. The finding of a beneficial effect for baseline marijuana users further supports this conclusion.

3031221,USA/Canada,Primary/Elementary,Literacy/English,"Background: This study evaluated the impact on student's writing ability of a structured writing program, called 'Writing Wings,' for 3rd, 4th, and 5th graders developed by the Success For All Foundation (SFAF). Writing is a critical skill for success in school. Purpose: The study was intended to answer one confirmatory question, 'What is the impact of 'Writing Wings' on the writing ability of 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade elementary students?'; and two exploratory questions--'What is the impact of 'Writing Wings' on the writing attitudes and practices of 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade elementary students?' and 'Do the impacts vary by the characteristics of the students and their teachers?' Setting: A total of 39 schools, from 21 states, participated in the study over two years (2005-06 and 2006-07). Study Sample: A total of 39 schools, 150 teachers and 3,000 students. Teachers were randomized to a treatment or control group. Intervention: 'Writing Wings' is designed to enhance teachers' skills through a combination of clear instructional goals, teacher modeling, and a cooperative writing process. The program consists of twelve units of detailed daily lesson plans that support instruction in descriptive, informative, persuasive, and narrative writing. Each unit includes writing prompts and writing challenges, with instruction spanning over ten days. Within units, lessons highlight the writing process of planning, drafting, sharing and responding, revising, and editing. The lessons include language mechanics and are rich with cooperative learning opportunities. Research Design: Experimental; Control or Comparison Condition: Business as usual writing instruction. Data Collection and Analysis: Data collection included a researcher-administered student writing test and survey, a teacher survey, teacher ratings of students' writing ability, and assessments of implementation fidelity. Impact analysis was done using HLM hierarchical linear modeling]. Findings: The results indicate some impact on instructional practices, however, no overall impacts on students' writing ability. The exploratory analyses provide evidence of: a relatively large overall positive impact on the frequency of student-reported in-school writing for low-ability students; and, subgroup impacts on the written organization skills for 5th grade students. Conclusion: The limited student impacts may arise because the observed effects on teaching practices was inadequate to sufficiently affect student outcomes. The time required for teachers to reach an acceptable level of implementation was slower than originally expected.

3031897,Rest of Europe,Middle/High School,Numeracy/Maths,"This article examines an educational experiment with a unique combination of 3 elements: homework, the use of information and communication technology and a large degree of freedom of choice (student autonomy). More particularly, we study the effectiveness of a web-based intelligent tutoring system (ITS) that a school offers to its students as optional homework, in a sample of 355 first-year secondary students, using an experimental design. The results show that whether students make this noncompulsory homework in the web-based ITS is dependent on their prior achievement and their teacher, and if they practice, they tend to choose easier modules. Students thus do not seem to optimize learning gains, but rather balance their perceived value of practicing and their ï¿½expectancy,ï¿½ as found previously for regular (compulsory, non-ITS) homework. Regarding the value of choice, findings suggest that students may be poor judges of their most beneficial exercises pattern. Differentiation in ITS does not guarantee learning, unless scaffolding is tightly linked to it. In line with previous research, this research shows that practice does matter, though at varying intensities. Yet it also clarifies that motivation to make an effort is required, which adds to the lessons learned from homework research; both the perceived value and expectancy are at play and can be enhanced, for example, by teachers.

At the beginning of the school year, all entering students participated in a comprehensive kindergarten screening. As a result of this screening 44 students were identified as 'at-risk' of early school failure and randomly assigned to either the experimental group utilizing the cognitive developmental curriculum or to a regular kindergarten class utilizing a curriculum-mastery model. At the end of the intervention year, all students were post-tested and routine school procedure followed for recommended promotion or retention. No further interventions, other than year-end evaluations, were conducted for either group. Thirty-six students (82% of the original sample) were located and data on them collected near and the end of each of the two follow-up years. Long-term program effectiveness was measured using three dependent variables: academic achievement, adaptation to a school environment, and social and emotional behaviors. The data from both follow-up phases were analyzed using three separate repeated measure ANOVA. No significant difference was obtained between the groups on the measure of academic achievement; however, the experimental group demonstrated significant academic growth (p $<$.05) while the control group's academic achievement actually declined. No significant difference was obtained between the groups on the measure of adaptation to a school environment; however, the experimental group was considered significantly better behaved than their counterparts (p $<$.01) as evidenced by the measure of social and emotional behaviors. Significant educational differences were also found in the academic status of the two groups. By the end of the second follow-up year no Discovery children had technically repeated a grade, while 50 percent of the control group had been placed in special education classes as contrasted to six percent of the experimental group. These findings, based on a two-year follow-up of a small sample of at-risk children, are by no means definitive; however, early results warrant optimism about the effectiveness of the program.","The Discovery Kindergarten Program: A longitudinal comparison of the academic achievement, school adaptation, and social and emotional behaviors of two groups of high risk students","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Discovery+Kindergarten+Program:+A+longitudinal+comparison+of+the+academic+achievement,+school+adaptation,+and+social+and+emotional+behaviors+of+two+groups+of+high+risk+students",1988,Targeted,Regular Teachers/Lecturers,Full Academic Year or Longer,Behaviour and Social Wellbeing,Behaviour and Social Wellbeing,Single,44,NA,Yes,Whole Sample Only,At Least Some Follow-Up,Yes,No,"Yes, Theoretical Perspectives",Yes,USA/Canada Preschool/Kindergarten Range of Academic Outcomes
3031501,NA,NA,NA,"Prior investigations have linked behavioral competencies with decreased risk for later drug involvement among adolescents. The current investigation sought to clarify the distal impact of two universal preventive interventions on incident alcohol, inhalant, tobacco, and illicit drug sampling through early adolescence. Participants were 678 predominantly African-American first graders in the Baltimore City Public School System. Approximately, 80% of the sample was followed from first to eighth grades. Two theory-based preventive interventions, (1) a family-school partnership (FSP) intervention and (2) a classroom-centered (CC) intervention, were developed to reduce early risk behaviors in first grade. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used estimate the relative profiles of drug involvement among intervention youths relative to those in the standard educational setting, i.e., the control group. Relative to the control group, intervention youths were less likely to use tobacco [cumulative incidence= 0.47 vs 0.35; Relative Risk (RR) 0.47, p=0.001]. The intervention impact on risk of starting tobacco was stronger for the CC intervention (RR=0.53; p=0.008) than the FSP intervention (RR=0.62; p=0.042). Intervention status was not associated with use of alcohol, inhalants, or marijuana use, but was associated with the risk of other illegal drugs including heroin, crack, and cocaine for the CC intervention (RR=0.32, P=0.042). This study provides confirmatory evidence of the work of Storr, et al. (2002) that the both interventions have prevented or delayed the onset of tobacco smoking and adds new evidence on the CC intervention impact on risk of starting illegal frug use excluding marijuana.

A total of 37 schools at 4 sites were randomized to 4 conditions: (1) a universal intervention that involved implementing a student curriculum and teacher training with 6th-grade students and teachers, (2) a selective intervention in which a family intervention was implemented with a subset of 6th-grade students exhibiting high levels of aggression and social influence, (3) a combined intervention condition, and (4) a no-intervention control condition. Analyses of multiple waves of data from 2 cohorts of students at each school (N = 5,581) within the grade targeted by the interventions revealed a complex pattern. There was some evidence to suggest that the universal intervention was associated with increases in aggression and reductions in victimization; however, these effects were moderated by preintervention risk.

3031514,UK/Ireland,College/University,Professional Training,"BACKGROUND: Ethnic minority (EM) medical students and doctors underperform academically, but little evidence exists on how to ameliorate the problem. Psychologists Cohen et al. recently demonstrated that a written self-affirmation intervention substantially improved EM adolescents' school grades several months later. Cohen et al.'s methods were replicated in the different setting of UK undergraduate medical education. METHODS: All 348 Year 3 white (W) and EM students at one UK medical school were randomly allocated to an intervention condition (writing about one's own values) or a control condition (writing about another's values), via their tutor group. Students and assessors were blind to the existence of the study. Group comparisons on post-intervention written and OSCE (clinical) assessment scores adjusted for baseline written assessment scores were made using two-way analysis of covariance. All assessment scores were transformed to z-scores (mean = 0 standard deviation = 1) for ease of comparison. Comparisons between types of words used in essays were calculated using t-tests. The study was covered by University Ethics Committee guidelines. RESULTS: Groups were statistically identical at baseline on demographic and psychological factors, and analysis was by intention to treat [intervention group EM n = 95, W n = 79; control group EM n = 77; W n = 84]. As predicted, there was a significant ethnicity by intervention interaction [F(4,334) = 5.74; p = 0.017] on the written assessment. Unexpectedly, this was due to decreased scores in the W intervention group [mean difference = 0.283; (95% CI = 0.093 to 0.474] not improved EM intervention group scores [mean difference = -0.060 (95% CI = -0.268 to 0.148)]. On the OSCE, both W and EM intervention groups outperformed controls [mean difference = 0.261; (95%CI = -0.047 to -0.476; p = 0.013)]. The intervention group used more optimistic words (p < 0.001) and more 'I' and 'self' pronouns in their essays (p < 0.001), whereas the control group used more 'other' pronouns (p < 0.001) and more negations (p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: Cohen et al.'s finding that a brief self-affirmation task narrowed the ethnic academic achievement gap was replicated on the written assessment but against expectations, this was due to reduced performance in the W group. On the OSCE, the intervention improved performance in both W and EM groups. In the intervention condition, participants tended to write about themselves and used more optimistic words than in the control group, indicating the task was completed as requested. The study shows that minimal interventions can have substantial educational outcomes several months later, which has implications for the multitude of seemingly trivial changes in teaching that are made on an everyday basis, whose consequences are never formally assessed.",The effect of a brief social intervention on the examination results of UK medical students: a cluster randomised controlled trial,https://www.google.com/search?q=The+effect+of+a+brief+social+intervention+on+the+examination+results+of+UK+medical+students:+a+cluster+randomised+controlled+trial,2009,Universal,Regular Teachers/Lecturers,More than One Term,Professional Training,Professional Training,Clustered,348,12,Yes,Some Sub-Groups Reported,Immediate Post-Test Only,Yes,No,"Yes, Theoretical Perspectives",Yes,UK/Ireland College/University Professional Training

The purpose of this study is to report the effects of the ToyBox-intervention (a European 24-week cluster randomised controlled trial) on sedentary behaviour in preschoolers.Methods: In Belgium, 859 preschoolers from 27 kindergartens (15 intervention and 12 control) wore an accelerometer to objectively measure their sedentary time and 1715 parents/caregivers completed a questionnaire to assess sedentary activities in which preschoolers participate at home. Main outcomes were objectively measured sedentary time, time spent watching TV, using the computer and time spent in quiet play. Multilevel repeated measures analyses were conducted to take clustering into account. Intention to treat analysis was used to handle missing data.Results: A sample of 859 (29.5 % of all contacted children) preschoolers (4.4 &plusmn; 0.6 years, 54.4 % boys) provided valid accelerometer data at either baseline or follow-up and parents of 1715 (58.9 % of all contacted children) preschoolers (4.4 &plusmn; 0.5 years, 52.5 % boys) completed a questionnaire at either baseline or follow-up. No intervention effects were found on objectively and subjectively measured total sedentary time in the total sample. However, some effects on objectively and subjectively measured sedentary time were found in specific subgroups. Preschoolers from the intervention group from high SES kindergartens and preschoolers with high levels of sedentary time at baseline decreased their sedentary time, while preschoolers from the control group increased their sedentary time. Girls in the intervention group decreased their TV viewing time during weekend days (-5.83 min/day), while girls??ï¿½ &TV viewing in the control group increased (+4.15 min/day). In low SES kindergartens, a smaller increase for computer time during weekend days was found in preschoolers in intervention kindergartens (+6.06 min/day) than in control kindergartens (+12.49 min/day).Conclusion: While some small positive effects were found in some sub-groups, the ToyBox-intervention had no effect on objectively and subjectively measured sedentary time in the total sample. A longer period to implement the intervention and a more active involvement of parents/caregivers might enhance intervention effects.

Aim: To measure the effect of a short integrated study skills programme (SSP) on the study progress of at-risk medical students. Methods: First-year students identified as at-risk of academic failure at 7 months after enrolment were invited to participate in the randomised controlled trial. Participants were randomly assigned to the SSP group or to a control group receiving standard academic support. Effects of SSP were measured on the short (passed first exam after intervention), medium (obtained enough credits to proceed to second year) and long term (completed first-year curriculum within 2 years). Results: SSP participants (n?=?43) more often passed the first exam after the intervention than controls (n?=?41; 30% versus 12%; X2(1)?=?4.06, p?<?0.005, effect size?=?0.22), in particular those who had previously passed at least one exam. No medium or long-term effect was found. Participants who had attended four or five SSP sessions outperformed those who had attended fewer sessions on all outcome measures.

One factor, sense of coherence (SOC) has been related to general and oral health, clinical status, oral health behaviours and oral health related quality of life (OHRQoL) in observational research with adults and children. Thus, improving SOC may be a way to improve OHRQoL.   Aims of the study: To evaluate the effect of an intervention to enhance SOC on OHRQoL in children.   Methods: Cluster randomised trial in twelve primary schools in Khonkaen, Thailand with 257 grade 5 students. Six schools were allocated randomly to the study and comparison groups respectively. Data included socio-demographic and clinical data. Self-report questionnaires assessed OHRQoL using the child perceptions questionnaire, CPQ11-14 and SOC with the 13-item SOC scale. Data were collected at three time points; at baseline, two weeks after the intervention and at 3 month follow up.   Intervention: Seven 40-60 minute sessions over two months, focusing on child participation and empowerment. The first four sessions were classroom activities and included a mixture of didactic teaching, discussion, activities and games. The last three involved working on healthy school projects. The intervention was delivered by trained teachers who received an intensive one day course.   Results: The two groups were similar for all variables at baseline. The intervention group had significant improvements in SOC and CPQ11-14 scores representing better OHRQoL at two weeks after the intervention and 3 month follow-up. SOC had a direct effect on symptoms and indirect effect on OHRQoL via symptoms.

tonal and rhythm patterns from Edwin Gordon’s Music Learning Theory on the tonal and
rhythmic discrimination abilities of second-grade students. The secondary purpose of this
study was to determine whether there was a relationship among the extent of music
experience, preference for music activities, and the tonal and rhythmic discrimination
abilities across four groups of second-grade students.
Participants were four intact second-grade general music classes from one
elementary school in North Carolina. The classes were assigned randomly to three
experimental groups and one control group. I instructed the experimental groups using
Edwin Gordon’s aural-based tonal patterns in Music Learning Theory for ten minutes
each class period during a treatment week and rhythm patterns the next treatment week.
The experimental groups were assigned randomly to one of three conditions: (a) playing
instruments only, (b) singing and chanting only, and (c) singing, chanting, and playing
instruments. The control group did not receive tonal and rhythm pattern instruction;
instead, I instructed participants for ten minutes each class period using classroom
activities from the Spotlight on Music second-grade textbook series. At the beginning of
the study, all participants were administered the Primary Measures of Music Audiation
(PMMA) to measure their developmental music aptitude. Participants were administered
a researcher-created questionnaire to determine the extent of their musical experience and
their music activity preferences. Some students were selected at random to be
interviewed by me to provide additional information about their questionnaire responses.
At the end of the study, all participants were administered the PMMA as a posttest. The
research study period was August 31 – December 16, 2015, with twelve weeks allotted
for the instructional treatment period.
Using the pretest as the covariate, an ANCOVA was performed to determine
whether there were any significant main effects or interaction effects of instruction.
Results of the ANCOVA analyses indicated there were no significant main effects or
interaction effects of instruction for any of the PMMA subtests at the .05 level of
significance. Stepwise multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine whether
there were significant relationships among the extent of music experience, preference for
music activities, and the PMMA scores. Results indicated that preference for jazz and the
genre labeled “other” (i.e., rap, hip-hop, and “Kidz Bop”) were small, negative predictors
for PMMA tonal scores. Preference for singing as a favorite music activity was a small,
negative predictor for PMMA rhythm scores, and preference for the pop genre was a
small, positive predictor for PMMA rhythm scores. Jazz genre preference was a small,
negative predictor for PMMA composite scores, while pop genre preference was a small,
positive predictor. The control group, as compared to the three experimental groups, was
a small, positive predictor for PMMA rhythm scores only. Based on these results, aural
instruction with tonal and rhythm patterns from Edwin Gordon's Music Learning Theory
did not have a significant effect on the tonal and rhythmic discrimination abilities of

3031470,UK/Ireland,College/University,Professional Training,"BACKGROUND: High quality health care demands a nursing workforce with sound clinical skills. However, the clinical competency of newly qualified nurses continues to stimulate debate about the adequacy of current methods of clinical skills education and emphasises the need for innovative teaching strategies. Despite the increasing use of e-learning within nurse education, evidence to support its use for clinical skills teaching is limited and inconclusive. OBJECTIVES: This study tested whether nursing students could learn and retain the theory and skill of handwashing more effectively when taught using computer-assisted learning compared with conventional face-to-face methods. DESIGN: The study employed a two group randomised controlled design. The intervention group used an interactive, multimedia, self-directed computer-assisted learning module. The control group was taught by an experienced lecturer in a clinical skills room. Data were collected over a 5-month period between October 2004 and February 2005. Knowledge was tested at four time points and handwashing skills were assessed twice. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Two-hundred and forty-two first year nursing students of mixed gender; age; educational background and first language studying at one British university were recruited to the study. Participant attrition increased during the study. RESULTS: Knowledge scores increased significantly from baseline in both groups and no significant differences were detected between the scores of the two groups. Skill performance scores were similar in both groups at the 2-week follow-up with significant differences emerging at the 8-week follow-up in favour of the intervention group, however, this finding must be interpreted with caution in light of sample size and attrition rates.

We also compare the effectiveness of varying the reward recipient (parents or students) and the incentive structure (piece rate or lottery). Our preliminary results suggest that while the overall effects of the incentives are modest, the program has significant effects among students in the middle of the achievement range - that is, those students on the margin for meeting the monthly achievement standards.

The focus was on the potential benefits of using software for practising reading skills. A total of six secondary schools, located in Bradford, Leeds, and York with differing student profiles, participated in the study. The total number of students involved in the study was 665 in 23 classes. Each school was involved for 10 weeks, over a single term, during the course of the academic year 2006- 2007.  The main strategy was experimental, adopting a cluster randomised control trial design, in which Year 7 students were stratified according to the size then randomly allocated to one of the two groups.

DESIGN: In this randomized controlled trial, 22 adolescents (13-19 yrs old) from a special school for children with physical disabilities were randomly allocated to the experimental and control training groups. The experimental training group underwent a treadmill program without body weight support at a comfortable speed. The control group received treatment with conventional physiotherapy, which consisted of three sets of exercises with mat activities, balance, gait training, and functional gross motor activities. The program lasted 12 wks with a frequency of three times per week for both groups. Pretest and posttest measurements of self-selected walking speed, gross motor function, and spasticity were conducted. RESULTS: The analysis of covariance findings examining posttest differences between groups were significant with respect to self-selected walking speed (F = 8.545, P = 0.000) and gross motor function (F = 9.088, P = 0.007), whereas no significance was found for spasticity.

A large portion of the existing nursing research reflects the coping of adults, rather than children. Research relating to the coping of children has profound implications for nursing. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of two group interventions: a relaxation/imagery program and information only upon the coping strategies and stressors of rural school age children. Lazarus and Folkman's (1984) stress-coping theoretical model served as the conceptual framework for the study. The project used a field experimental design. Ninety-two school age children from one rural school participated in the study. The children in this study were able to cognitively appraise their stressors and initiate coping strategies.

The program significantly increases enrollment and test scores among all children, eliminates the 21 percentage point gender disparity in enrollment, and dramatically reduces the disparity in test scores. The intervention increases formal school enrollment by 42 percentage points among all children and increases test scores by 0.51 standard deviations (1.2 standard deviations for children that enroll in school). While all students benefit, the effects accrue disproportionately to girls. Evidence suggests that the village-based schools provide a comparable education to traditional schools. Estimating the effects of distance on academic outcomes, children prove very sensitive: enrollment and test scores fall by 16 percentage points and 0.19 standard deviations per mile.

measured via weekly logs completed by teachers, and a
semi-structured questionnaire completed by PATHS
coaches was used as a global measure of fidelity (capturing
adherence, dose and quality). A cost-consequence

Dutch at-risk students from 13 schools received in first and second grade a computerized reading intervention, delivered by non-professional tutors at school. Digital logs indicated that treatment integrity was lower than intended; therefore, the intervention group was subdivided using a completion criterion. Third grade assessments revealed that the subgroup that had finished the program successfully (IF, N = 40) was able to read as fluent as the average reader, outperforming the subgroup that had not completely finished the program (InF, N = 31) as well as the group that had not worked with the program (controls, N = 66) on all reading measures.

METHODS: Cluster Randomised Controlled Trial. Seven European countries participated in the study; 170 schools (7079 pupils 12-14 years of age) were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions or to a control condition during the school year 2004/2005. A pre-test survey assessing past and current substance use was conducted before the implementation of the program. The program consisted in 12-hour class-based curriculum based on a comprehensive social-influence approach. A post-test survey was carried out in all participating schools, 3 months after the end of the program. The association between program condition and change in substance use at post-test was expressed as adjusted Prevalence Odds Ratio (POR), estimated by multilevel regression model. RESULTS: Program effects were found for daily cigarette smoking (POR=0.70; 0.52-0.94) and episodes of drunkenness in the past 30 days (POR=0.72; 0.58-0.90 for at least one episode, POR=0.69; 0.48-0.99 for three or more episodes), while effects on Cannabis use in the past 30 days were of marginal statistical significance (POR=0.77; 0.60-1.00).

OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of a training program in interviewing on 1) residents' attitudes toward and skills in interviewing and 2) patients' physical and psychosocial well-being and satisfaction with care. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled study. SETTING: Two university-based primary care residencies. PARTICIPANTS: 63 primary care residents in postgraduate year 1. INTERVENTION: A 1-month, full-time rotation in interviewing and related psychosocial topics. MEASUREMENTS: Residents and their patients were assessed before and after the 1-month rotation. Questionnaires were used to assess residents' commitment to interviewing and psychosocial medicine, estimate of the importance of such care, and confidence in their ability to provide such care. Knowledge of interviewing and psychosocial medicine was assessed with a multiple-choice test. Audiotaped interviews with real patients and videotaped interviews with simulated patients were rated for specific interviewing behaviors. Patients' anxiety, depression, and social dysfunction; role limitations; somatic symptom status; and levels of satisfaction with medical visits were assessed by questionnaires and telephone interviews. RESULTS: Trained residents were superior to untrained residents in knowledge (difference in adjusted post-test mean scores, 15.7% [95% CI, 11% to 20%]); attitudes, such as confidence in psychological sensitivity (difference, 0.61 points on a 7-point scale [CI, 0.32 to 0.91 points]); somatization management (difference, 0.99 points [CI, 0.64 to 1.35 points]); interviewing of real patients (difference, 1.39 points on an 11-point scale [CI, 0.32 to 2.45 points]); and interviewing (data gathering) of simulated patients (difference, 2.67 points [CI, 1.77 to 3.56 points]). Mean differences between the study groups were consistently in the appropriate direction for patient satisfaction and patient well-being, but effect sizes were too small to be considered meaningful.

3031013,UK/Ireland,Primary/Elementary,Literacy/English,"This article presents the findings of a randomized controlled trial evaluation of the effects of a revised version of the volunteer mentoring programme, 'Time to Read.' Participating children received two 30-minute mentoring sessions per week from volunteer mentors who carried out paired reading activities with the children. The current trial involved 512 children aged eight to nine years from 50 primary schools. The programme was found to be effective in improving decoding skills (d = +0.15), reading rate (d = +0.22) and reading fluency (d = +0.14) and there was some evidence of a positive effect in relation to the children's aspirations for the future (d = +0.11). However, no evidence was found of the programme having an effect on reading comprehension or reading confidence and enjoyment of reading. The article concludes by suggesting that mentoring programmes using non-specialist volunteers can be effective in improving foundational reading skills but would appear to be less effective in terms of improving higher-order skills such as comprehension. The article also suggests that such programmes are likely to be most effective if concentrating on core reading activities rather than attempting to address reading outcomes indirectly through improving children's confidence or wider enjoyment of reading.

Intermediate Measures of Music Audiation (IMMA) effect the rhythmic improvisation
performance of second-grade elementary general music students? The research design

All participants were measured pre- and post-intervention using measures of abstract reasoning, metacognition, problem-solving functional behaviour in the home environment or social situations and individual goal-directed behaviour. Results: Significant differences in post-test scores were found for all measurements between children in the experimental group and those in the comparison group, using the baselines of dependent variables, years of schooling and the full IQ scores as the covariates. Conclusion: The results of this study supported the use of explicit problem-solving skills training to improve daily functioning for children with ABI, and the need for a larger-scale, randomised controlled study with long-term follow-up.

5132749,USA/Canada,Primary/Elementary,Other School Subjects,"This randomized controlled trial or ‘true experiment' examines the effects of a school garden intervention on the science knowledge of elementary school children. Schools were randomly assigned to a group that received the garden intervention (n = 25) or to a waitlist control group that received the garden intervention at the end of the study (n = 24). The garden intervention consisted of both raised-bed garden kits and a series of 19 lessons. Schools, located in the US states of Arkansas, Iowa, Washington, and New York, were all low-income as defined by having 50% or more children qualifying for the federal school lunch program. Participants were students in second, fourth, and fifth grade (ages 6–12) at baseline (n = 3,061). Science knowledge was measured using a 7-item questionnaire focused on nutritional science and plant science. The survey was administered at baseline (Fall 2011) and at three time points during the intervention (Spring 2012, Fall 2012, and Spring 2013). Garden intervention fidelity (GIF) captured the robustness or fidelity of the intervention delivered in each classroom based on both lessons delivered and garden activities. Analyses were conducted using general linear mixed models. Survey data indicated that among children in the garden intervention, science knowledge increased from baseline to follow-up more than among control group children. However, science knowledge scores were uniformly poor and gains were very modest. GIF, which takes into account the robustness of the intervention, revealed a dose–response relation with science knowledge: more robust or substantial intervention implementations corresponded to stronger treatment effects.

One theory as to why students do not succeed in college is that they lack key information about how to be successful or fail to act on the information that they have. We present evidence from a randomized experiment which tests the effectiveness of individualized student coaching. Over the course of two separate school years, InsideTrack, a student coaching service, provided coaching to students from public, private, and proprietary universities. Most of the participating students were non-traditional college students enrolled in degree programs. The participating universities and InsideTrack randomly assigned students to be coached. The coach contacted students regularly to develop a clear vision of their goals, to guide them in connecting their daily activities to their long term goals, and to support them in building skills, including time management, self advocacy, and study skills. Students who were randomly assigned to a coach were more likely to persist during the treatment period, and were more likely to be attending the university one year after the coaching had ended.

The study also analyzed the relationship between achievement gains on the DEA and the number of nonfiction books read. Test data from the 2013 fall, 2014 winter, and 2014 spring administrations of the DEA as well as data from ARP during the 2013ï¿½2014 school year of two Title I elementary public schools in West Tennessee were used. The data were compared between 250 second-grade students from the control and experimental groups, and 250 third-grade students from the control and experimental groups. Five research questions were analyzed pertaining to the effectiveness of the ARP. An independent samples t test was conducted for Research Questions 1 and 2. The findings showed that the addition of the ARP resulted in an increase in reading achievement growth on the DEA compared to the reading achievement growth of students who did not participated in the ARP. A Pearson Correlation was conducted on Research Question 3, which revealed that no statistically significant relationship existed between the number of nonfiction books read and the studentsï¿½ reading achievement on the DEA. A two-factor ANOVA was performed on Research Questions 4 and 5. The results revealed that the ARP use affected the second- and third-grade studentsï¿½ reading achievement, but the second-grade females scored higher than the males, and no difference existed in the scores between the genders of the third-grade students.

The aims of this study were to evaluate the immediate effects of the participation of patients with cancer on the attitudes and skills of undergraduate medical students receiving an interview skills training programme, and to assess the effects of the participation of patients with cancer on the attitudes and interview performance of students 2 years later. It was hypothesised that the participation of cancer patients would have specific beneficial effects on attitudes and interview performance. Before participating in a 6-session interview methods course in third year, students were randomised to be taught with patients who had cancer (experimental group) or with patients with other diagnoses (control group). Before and after participating in the course, 233 students (94% response rate) completed an Attitudes Questionnaire. When they reached their fifth year, 54 students again completed the Attitudes Questionnaire and, in addition, made a video recording of an interview with a patient who had gynaecological cancer. These recordings were rated independently by two researchers using the Interview Rating Instrument. Immediately after the course, a number of differences were found between the two groups. For example, students in the experimental group were more likely to consider the ability to listen an extremely important characteristic of hospital doctors and to consider more strongly that trust is an essential part of the doctor-patient relationship. 2 years after the course, the ability of hospital doctors to communicate with patients, and the need for clinical decisions to reflect patients' wishes, were considered to be more important by students in the experimental group, although even 96% of controls felt both these issues were very or extremely important. As hypothesised, the experimental group had better ratings in terms of responding empathically, showing regard and concern for the patient, and assessing the impact of the symptoms on the patient's life.

3031231,USA/Canada,Preschool/Kindergarten,Behaviour and Social Wellbeing,"The field of early intervention is currently faced with the challenge of reducing the prevalence of antisocial behavior in children. Longitudinal outcomes research indicates that increased antisocial behavior and impairments in social competence skills during the preschool years often serve as harbingers of future adjustment problems in a number of domains including mental health, interpersonal relations, and academic achievement. This article reports the results of a cross-site randomized controlled trial, in which 128 preschool children with challenging behaviors were assigned to either a Preschool First Step to Success (PFS) intervention (i.e., experimental) or a usual-care (i.e., control) group. Regression analyses indicated that children assigned to the Preschool First Step intervention had significantly higher social skills, and significantly fewer behavior problems, across a variety of teacher- and parent-reported measures at postintervention. Effect sizes for teacher-reported effects ranged from medium to large across a variety of social competency indicators; effect sizes for parent-reported social skills and problem behaviors were small to medium, respectively. These results suggest that the preschool adaptation of the First Step intervention program provides early intervention participants, staff, and professionals with a viable intervention option to address emerging antisocial behavior and externalizing behavior disorders prior to school entry.

Method: Two hundred sixteen children between the ages of 6 and 9 years with language impairments were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 conditions: (a) Fast ForWord Language (FFW-L), (b) academic enrichment (AE), (c) computer-assisted language intervention (CALI), or (d) individualized language intervention (ILI) provided by a speech-language pathologist. All children received 1 hr and 40 min of treatment, 5 days per week, for 6 weeks. Language and auditory processing measures were administered to the children by blinded examiners before treatment, immediately after treatment, 3 months after treatment, and 6 months after treatment. Results: The children in all 4 conditions improved significantly on a global language test and a test of backward masking. Children with poor backward masking scores who were randomized to the FFW-L condition did not present greater improvement on the language measures than children with poor backward masking scores who were randomized to the other 3 conditions. Effect sizes, analyses of standard error of measurement, and normalization percentages supported the clinical significance of the improvements on the Comprehensive Assessment of Spoken Language (E. Carrow-Woolfolk, 1999). There was a treatment effect for the Blending Words subtest of the Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing (R. K. Wagner, J. K. Torgesen, & C. A. Rashotte, 1999). Participants in the FFW-L and CALI conditions earned higher phonological awareness scores than children in the ILI and AE conditions at the 6-month followup testing. Conclusion: Fast ForWord Language, the intervention that provided modified speech to address a hypothesized underlying auditory processing deficit, was not more effective at improving general language skills or temporal processing skills than a nonspecific comparison treatment (AE) or specific language intervention comparison treatments (CALI and ILI) that did not contain modified speech stimuli. These findings call into question the temporal processing hypothesis of language impairment and the hypothesized benefits of using acoustically modified speech to improve language skills.

3030624,USA/Canada,Primary/Elementary,Behaviour and Social Wellbeing,"Background: Children with anxious or depressive symptoms are at risk of developing internalizing disorders and their attendant morbidity. To prevent these outcomes, school-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been developed, but few studies include active control conditions. We evaluated a preventive CBT program targeting internalizing symptoms relative to an activity contrast condition post-intervention and at 1-year follow-up. Methods: One thousand one hundred and thirty-nine children from Grades 3-6 from a diverse sample of schools, were screened with the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children and Children's Depression Inventory. Those with t>60 on either measure were offered participation in a randomized 12-week trial, school-based group CBT versus a structured after-school activity group of equal duration. We explored several therapeutic elements as potential predictors of change. Results: One hundred and forty-eight children participated (84 boys, 64 girls; 78 CBT, 70 contrast; 57% Caucasian) and 145 completed the program. Self-reported anxious and depressive symptoms decreased significantly over time (2=5.15 and.133, respectively), with no group by time interaction. There was a trend toward fewer children meeting diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder on the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule at 1-year post-CBT than postcontrast (6/76 versus 12/69). Positive reinforcement of child behavior was associated with change in anxiety symptoms; checking homework was understood with change in depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Findings suggest that children with internalizing symptoms may benefit from both school-based CBT and structured activity programs.

We investigated two implementations of the flipped classroom. The first implementation did not actively encourage cooperative learning, with students progressing through the course at their own pace. With this implementation, student examination scores did not differ between the lecture classes and the flipped classroom. The second implementation was organised with cooperative learning activities. In a randomised control-group pretest-posttest experiment, student scores on a post-test and on the final examination were significantly higher for the flipped classroom group than for the control group receiving traditional lectures. This demonstrates that the classroom flip, if properly implemented with cooperative learning, can lead to increased academic performance.

METHODS: A low-income school district volunteered for participation in the study. All schools in the district agreed to participate (elementary?=?6, middle school?=?2) and were randomly assigned within school type to intervention (n?=?4) and control (n =4) conditions following a baseline environmental audit year. Intervention goals were to 1) eliminate unhealthy foods and beverages on campus, 2) develop nutrition services as the main source on campus for healthful eating (HE), and 3) promote school staff modeling of HE. Schools were followed across a baseline year and two intervention years. Longitudinal assessment of height and weight was conducted with second, third, and sixth grade children. Behavioral observation of the nutrition environment was used to index the amount of outside foods and beverages on campuses. Observations were made monthly in each targeted school environment and findings were presented as items per child per week. RESULTS: From an eligible 827 second, third, and sixth grade students, baseline height and weight were collected for 444 second and third grade and 135 sixth grade students (51% reach). Data were available for 73% of these enrolled students at the end of three years. Intervention school outside food and beverage items per child per week decreased over time and control school outside food and beverage items increased over time. The effects were especially pronounced for unhealthy foods and beverage items. Changes in rates of obesity for intervention school (28% baseline, 27%?year 1, 30%?year 2) were similar to those seen for control school (22% baseline, 22%?year 1, 25%?year 2) children.

5132803,Australia/New Zealand,Primary/Elementary,Behaviour and Social Wellbeing,"Aim: The aim was to evaluate the impact of a brief activity bout outside the classroom on boys' attention and on-task behaviour in the classroom setting. Methods: Fifty-eight boys (mean age 11.2 +/- 0.6 years) were recruited from a boys' elementary school in Adelaide, South Australia. Two year 5 and, similarly, two year 6 classes were assigned using a crossover design to either four weeks of a 10 minute Active Lesson Break followed by four weeks of a 10 minute Passive Lesson Break (reading) or visa versa. Attention was quantified using a computerised psychomotor vigilance task, and on-task behaviour by direct observation. Results: Neither the Active Lesson nor the Passive Lesson condition significantly affected sustained attention or on-task behaviour, and there were no significant differences between conditions. Conclusion: There was no impact on participants' sustained attention or on-task behaviour after a short activity break between lessons. Brief activity breaks outside the classroom do not compromise participants' on-task behaviour or attention levels upon returning to the classroom, although improvement in these variables is not seen either.

3030809,USA/Canada,Middle/High School,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of an obesity prevention intervention on use of self-induced vomiting/laxatives (purging) and diet pills to control weight in girls in early adolescence. DESIGN: We matched and randomly assigned 10 middle schools to an intervention or a control condition in a randomized controlled trial. Longitudinal multivariable analyses using generalized estimating equations were conducted with data from 480 girls to examine the effects of the intervention on the risk of reporting a new case of purging or diet pill use to control weight at follow-up 21 months later, while controlling for ethnicity and school matched pairs. Girls who reported purging or using diet pills at baseline were excluded from analyses. SETTING: Middle schools. PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred eighty girls in early adolescence aged 10 to 14 years (mean age, 11.5 years). INTERVENTION: The Planet Health obesity prevention program was implemented during 2 school years and was designed to promote healthful nutrition and physical activity and to reduce television viewing. OUTCOME: Reduced risk of using self-induced vomiting/laxatives or diet pills to control weight in the past 30 days. RESULTS: After the intervention, we found 14 (6.2%) of 226 girls in control schools and 7 (2.8%) of 254 girls in intervention schools reported purging or using diet pills to control their weight (P = .003). In a multivariable generalized estimating equation model, girls in intervention schools were less than half as likely to report purging or using diet pills at follow-up compared with girls in control schools (odds ratio, 0.41; 95% confidence interval, 0.22-0.75).

Outcomes examined for participants during their 1st year of participation include performance on a standardized test of critical thinking skills, credit acquisition, achievement motivation, educational aspirations, personal development, and institutional (prison) climate. A cluster randomized design was used in which prisons in six states were randomly assigned to implement the Correctional Education Association College of the Air (CEA/COA) program or control programming. Analyses show that students in the CEA/COA program had average critical thinking scores that were about three fourths of a point lower, as measured by the Collegiate Assessment of Academic Proficiency (effect size = -0.14), and acquired on average approximately two fewer credits (effect size = -0.43) than students from control sites after 1 year.

3030644,USA/Canada,College/University,Professional Training,"Over the past decade, on-line databases have become increasingly popular among health care professionals. As a group, these 'end-users' report utilizing databases to keep abreast of medical progress, to conduct research and to address specific patient care issues. Throughout the literature, medical professionals ('content experts') have proved to be less effective searchers than librarians ('search experts'). The potential implications of this discrepancy are worrysome. For any given clinical scenario, for example, published reports may reach contradictory conclusions. A poorly skilled searcher may not retrieve enough articles to appreciate this fact. Optimizing searching skills is therefore a worthwhile goal. As a first step, many medical schools introduce students to on-line databases, most notably MEDLINE. Residency is an ideal time to continue this training. A recognized obstacle to provide residents with formal MEDLINE instruction is time constraint. We therefore conducted this study to ascertain the impact an individual 1-hour tutorial session would have on MEDLINE utilization among obstetrics and gynecology residents training at an academic medical centre. Outcome measures included MEDLINE search frequency, duration, recall, precision and searcher satisfaction. Search recall measures the searcher's ability to retrieve articles deemed relevant to the question at hand. Search precision gauges the searchers' ability to eliminate irrelevant articles. Although the sessions were well received, we were unable to demonstrate an improvement in the outcome measures analysed.

Effects of the intervention were compared with conventional, face-to-face classroom teaching on three outcomes: knowledge, satisfaction, and self-learning readiness. METHOD: A two-group, randomized, controlled design was used, involving 112 participants. Descriptive statistics and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) were performed. RESULTS: The teaching method was found to have no direct impact on knowledge acquisition, satisfaction, and self-learning readiness. However, motivation and teaching method had an interaction effect on knowledge acquisition by students. Among less motivated students, those in the intervention group performed better than those who received traditional training.

The link between dehydration and lower cognitive performance has been well-established among adult populations and among school children in high-income settings. However, until recently this relationship has not been evaluated among children in low-resource settings. We conducted a randomized control trial to investigate the relationship between cognition, hydration, and water consumption among children residing in a water-scarce setting. The protocol for the study was adapted from a pilot conducted in Mali. We visited five schools in Chipata province, Zambia, for one day each. Pupils were randomly assigned within each school to receive either a bottle of drinking water that they could refill throughout the day (water group, n=149) or were not provided with supplemental water and could only access drinking water that was normally available at the school (control group, n=143). We assessed hydration in the morning and afternoon using urine specific gravity (USG) measured with a portable refractometer. Children were considered dehydrated if their USG exceeded 1.015. In the afternoon, we administered six cognitive tests to assess shortterm memory, concentration, visual attention, and visual motor skills. Independent samples t-tests were used to compare cognitive test scores between the water and control groups, and linear regression was used to compare hydration level and cognitive test score. Mean morning USG was 1.018 for both water and control groups. Afternoon USG increased among the control group (1.022) and decreased among the water group (1.006). Mean scores for one of the cognitive tests were significantly higher among the water group. There was no significant difference in mean scores between the water and control groups for any other test, and there was no significant correlation between afternoon USG and any test scores. Results show that moderate dehydration among school children is prevalent and increases throughout the day in the absence of supplemental water, and increased access to water decreases dehydration prevalence.

This study evaluated the effectiveness of leadership training programs on self-esteem and self-efficacy among adolescents. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: a total of 180 students of the same grade of one secondary school were randomized into an intervention (n?=?50) and a control group (n?=?130). The students in the intervention group participated in a 6-month program of leadership training and service learning, while the control group did not participate in any training. Their self-esteem and self-efficacy were assessed by Rosenberg Self-Esteem questionnaire and Chinese Adaptation of the General Self-Efficacy Scale, respectively, before and after the program. Both scales have been recognized internationally as valid and reliable survey instruments to measure these psychological attributes. The scores were compared by Student's tests according to gender. A total of 180 students were enrolled during the study period October, 2009 to May, 2010. Their mean age was 15.18 years (0.62) and 56.7% were male. Students allocated to the intervention and control group had statistically similar demographic characteristics except gender (male 36.0% vs. 64.6%, p?=?0.001). Overall, the self-esteem scores increased by 1.28 and decreased by 0.30 (p?=?0.161) while the self-efficacy scores increased by 0.26 and decreased by 0.76 (p?=?0.429) in the intervention and control group, respectively.

The study was set in a rural middle school located in the foothills of North Carolina. Students selected for the study were identified utilizing Lexile levels to identify them as below grade level for sixth and seventh grade. Once students were identified, the teachers used Curriculum Based Measures (CBMs) to determine their current fluency levels. Oral reading fluency and MAZE CBMs were employed to measure speed, accuracy, rate, and comprehension. Classroom teachers also used a prosody rubric created by Zutell and Rasinski (1991) to determine the gain in prosody as a result of the intervention. Using a pre/posttest Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA), students participated in a 7-week study using repeated reading as an intervention.

Different types of support were provided to the first three groups of schools in order to help them establish SSE mechanisms, whereas no SSE mechanism was established in any of the schools of the fourth group. In the first group, school stakeholders were offered the opportunity to develop their own SSE mechanisms and design their own improvement strategies. The second group followed the same process in designing SSE mechanisms as the first, but before introducing this approach support was offered to the stakeholders in order to address and reduce their concerns about SSE. The third group was asked to develop SSE mechanisms and take decisions for their improvement strategies which were in line with the knowledge base of educational effectiveness research. All three experimental groups had better results than the control group, but the impact of the third approach on student achievement was higher than the impact of the other two approaches to SSE.

Design: Three-level models were fit using hierarchical linear modeling to determine the effect of SWPBIS on children's involvement in bullying. Setting: Thirty-seven Maryland public elementary schools. Participants: Data involved 12 344 children (52.9% male, 45.1% African American, 46.1% white) followed up longitudinally across 4 school years. Intervention:Arandomized controlled effectiveness trial of SWPBIS. Outcome Measures: Reports from teachers on bullyrelated behaviors were assessed through the Teacher Observation of Classroom Adaptation - Checklist. Results: Analyses indicated that children in schools that implemented SWPBIS displayed lower rates of teacherreported bullying and peer rejection than those in schools without SWPBIS. A significant interaction also emerged between grade level of first exposure to SWPBIS and intervention status, suggesting that the effects of SWPBIS on rejection were strongest among children who were first exposed to SWPBIS at a younger age. Conclusions: The results indicated that SWPBIS has a significant effect on teachers' reports of children's involvement in bullying as victims and perpetrators. The findings were considered in light of other outcomes for students, staff, and the school environment, and they suggest that SWPBIS may help address the increasing national concerns related to school bullying by improving school climate. 2012 American Medical Association.

3031201,Rest of Europe,College/University,Professional Training,"BACKGROUND: Italian Nursing Faculties use a range of tutorial strategies (laboratory sessions, intensive clinical tutoring, weekly tutoring) aimed to enhance nursing students' diagnostic reasoning: these strategies have different impacts on promoting student critical thinking. By using critical thinking methods, students develop abilities to check, monitor and constantly evaluate the accuracy of the diagnostic reasoning process. However, there is little evidence to show how effective tutorial strategies are on the accuracy of diagnostic reasoning. There is also very little known about the complexity of tutorial strategies because these are made up of several components (e.g. tutor questioning abilities, the value of the setting, the impact of the environment, the expertise of the tutor and the impact of the Faculty's philosophy of learning), tutorial strategies cannot be standardised and depend on multiple factors which are difficult to control. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to establish a relationship between tutorial strategies orientated to enhance critical thinking and the accuracy of diagnostic reasoning (i.e. the number of correct answers given by students on simulated cases in two different nursing education contexts). It was hypothesised that students who had had one laboratory session using intensive tutorial strategies had less probability of making reasoning errors in diagnosing a simulated case than a control group that had weekly tutorials or routine tutoring. DESIGN: A double pragmatic experimental study was adopted involving two Italian Nursing Faculties at universities in Verona and Udine. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 144 students in the first year of their Nursing Science Degree course were involved; in Verona, two random groups of 41 students were taken (an intervention group and a control group). Random selections of 39 students for the intervention group and 29 students for a control group were made from the second campus in Udine. Data analysis was conducted comparing student outcomes in the same faculty (intra-trial analysis) and between the two campuses involved (inter-trial analysis). RESULTS: The students doing laboratory sessions and intensive clinical tutorials demonstrated fewer errors compared to the control group [OR 3.75; IC 95% 1.77-7.88], although the students who receive routine tutoring, demonstrated higher risk of mistaking the problems of the patient [OR 0.22; IC 0.95% 0.07-0.65]. CONCLUSION: From intra- and inter-trial analysis of the results, it can be concluded within limits, that those students who had had intensive tutorial strategies aimed developing critical thinking abilities, formulated fewer wrong hypotheses in the first list they made when confronted with a new nursing case.

The Good Behavior Game (GBG) was directed at socializing children for the student role and reducing aggressive, disruptive behavior. Mastery Learning (ML) was aimed at improving academic achievement. Both were implemented by the teacher. METHODS: The design was epidemiologically based, with randomization at the school and classroom levels and balancing of children across classrooms. The trial involved a cohort of first-grade children in 19 schools and 41 classrooms with intervention at first and second grades. A replication was implemented with the next cohort of first grade children with the same teachers but with little mentoring or monitoring. RESULTS: In the first cohort, there was consistent and robust GBG-associated reduction of risk for suicide ideation by age 19-21 years compared to youths in standard setting (control) classrooms regardless of any type of covariate adjustment. A GBG-associated reduced risk for suicide attempt was found, though in some covariate-adjusted models the effect was not statistically robust. No statistically significant impact on these outcomes was found for ML. The impact of the GBG on suicide ideation and attempts was greatly reduced in the replication trial involving the second cohort.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study used the following task: suturing and knot tying task under a combination of four conditions. (1) The C (use of conventional instruments)-D (direct vision); (2) the C-V (indirect vision via a video monitor); (3) the L (use of laparoscopic instruments)-D; and (4) the L-V (the standard laparoscopic suturing and knot tying). The first study assessed 11 medical students undergoing L-V training. The time to complete each of the four assessment tasks was recorded pre- and post-training. The second study was a randomized, controlled trial involving 36 students grouped according to three types of training methods: the L-D, the C-V, and the L-V group. The improvement in the time to complete the L-V task was assessed and the Hiroshima University Endoscopic Surgical Assessment Device (HUESAD) was used for assessment as well. RESULTS: In the first study, a significant improvement in the performance time between pre- and post-training for the L-D task was found, but not for the C-V task. The second study found that the improvement rate of the L-D trained group was significantly greater than that of the C-V and L-V groups. The HUESAD assessment also showed the similar results.

One sophomore class was randomly assigned to either classroom teaching alone (traditional group; n = 65) or classroom teaching supplemented with Internet-based discussions of cases illustrating ethical issues (Internet component group; n = 62). A final case analysis comprehensively evaluated students' understanding of the analytic method taught in the course. Grades for both groups on the final case analyses, which were rated by two external reviewers, were compared. RESULTS: The students' understanding of ethical analysis, as measured by grades of external reviewers on the final paper, was significantly higher for those in the course with the Internet component than it was for those in the traditional course (3.0 +/- 0.6 and 2.6 +/- 0.7, respectively; p <.005).

The aim of our study was to evaluate moral competences of midwifery students during their whole university education (3 year course) based on their moral competences C-index. Material and Method: We performed randomized single blinded 3-year follow-up trial of 72 midwifery students. Standard Moral Judgment Test (MJT) By Georg Lind was used accompanied by own questionnaire. Moral competences were calculated (C-index) according to Lind's methodology. Subjects were also divided into active and passive ethics training to search for differences. Results. C-index varied during studies insignificant (p=0.14). Randomized groups were equal at the beginning point, no significant differences were noticed. Active ethics teaching did not increase C-index compared to controls in all measuring points (P1-P4, respectively p=0,41 and p=0,38). Conclusions. During 3 year studies at medical university moral competences measured by C-index varied insignificantly, but simultaneously the change in C-index was dependent on its value at the beginning of the trial. There was not statistically significant influence of active ethic's teaching compared to controls.

METHODS: Mother-adolescent dyads (n=1386) were randomly assigned to 2 groups: (1) a school-based smoking-prevention intervention or (2) the same intervention with a parent-based add-on component called Raising Smoke-Free Kids. Mothers in the experimental condition received the parent add-on component. Mothers in the control condition received information on selecting a high school. All adolescents received a version of Project Towards No Tobacco Use (TNT). The primary outcome was a reduction in adolescent cigarette smoking. Follow-up data were obtained from 1096 mother-adolescent dyads at 15 months postintervention. RESULTS: At follow-up, the odds of smoking cigarettes were reduced by 42% for adolescents in the parent add-on condition versus the TNT-only condition. Mothers in the parent add-on condition were more likely than were mothers in the TNT-only condition to set rules about risk-sensitive social activities and to be perceived as trustworthy by their child. Group differences also were found in the frequency and quality of mother-adolescent communication.

3031610,UK/Ireland,Middle/High School,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"BACKGROUND: Peer-led sex education is widely believed to be an effective approach to reducing unsafe sex among young people, but reliable evidence from long-term studies is lacking. To assess the effectiveness of one form of school-based peer-led sex education in reducing unintended teenage pregnancy, we did a cluster (school) randomised trial with 7 y of follow-up. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Twenty-seven representative schools in England, with over 9,000 pupils aged 13-14 y at baseline, took part in the trial. Schools were randomised to either peer-led sex education (intervention) or to continue their usual teacher-led sex education (control). Peer educators, aged 16-17 y, were trained to deliver three 1-h classroom sessions of sex education to 13- to 14-y-old pupils from the same schools. The sessions used participatory learning methods designed to improve the younger pupils' skills in sexual communication and condom use and their knowledge about pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), contraception, and local sexual health services. Main outcome measures were abortion and live births by age 20 y, determined by anonymised linkage of girls to routine (statutory) data. Assessment of these outcomes was blind to sex education allocation. The proportion of girls who had one or more abortions before age 20 y was the same in each arm (intervention, 5.0% [95% confidence interval (CI) 4.0%-6.3%]; control, 5.0% [95% CI 4.0%-6.4%]). The odds ratio (OR) adjusted for randomisation strata was 1.07 (95% CI 0.80-1.42, p = 0.64, intervention versus control). The proportion of girls with one or more live births by 20.5 y was 7.5% (95% CI 5.9%-9.6%) in the intervention arm and 10.6% (95% CI 6.8%-16.1%) in the control arm, adjusted OR 0.77 (0.51-1.15). Fewer girls in the peer-led arm self-reported a pregnancy by age 18 y (7.2% intervention versus 11.2% control, adjusted OR 0.62 [95% CI 0.42-0.91], weighted for non-response; response rate 61% intervention, 45% control). There were no significant differences for girls or boys in self-reported unprotected first sex, regretted or pressured sex, quality of current sexual relationship, diagnosed sexually transmitted diseases, or ability to identify local sexual health services. CONCLUSION: Compared with conventional school sex education at age 13-14 y, this form of peer-led sex education was not associated with change in teenage abortions, but may have led to fewer teenage births and was popular with pupils. It merits consideration within broader teenage pregnancy prevention strategies.",The long-term effects of a peer-led sex education programme (RIPPLE): a cluster randomised trial in schools in England,https://www.google.com/search?q=The+long-term+effects+of+a+peer-led+sex+education+programme+(RIPPLE):+a+cluster+randomised+trial+in+schools+in+England,2008,Universal,Mixture,Up to Half a Term,Behaviour and Social Wellbeing,none,Clustered,9000,27,No,Some Sub-Groups Reported,At Least Some Follow-Up,Yes,"Yes, Fairly Well","Yes, Descriptive Theory of Change",Yes,UK/Ireland Middle/High School Physical Health and Wellbeing

3031725,NA,NA,NA,"Introduction: Approximately 25% of Canadian pre-school aged children are overweight or obese. Physical Activity (PA) helps prevent obesity in school-aged children and adolescents, but very few trials have been conducted in pre-school aged children. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of intervening with daycare providers to increase PA and decrease adiposity in 3-5 year old children attending licensed daycares. Methods: A randomized controlled trial compared children (n = 40) whose day care providers received an intervention designed to promote PA versus children (n = 43) whose providers implemented the normal preschool curriculum. Intervention included two, 3-hour workshops plus 12 bi-monthly 'booster' sessions. Children were assessed at baseline and 6-months. PA was measured objectively using accelerometry. Adiposity was assessed by measured BMI and bioelectrical impedance analysis. Results: Linear mixed model analysis indicated no significant differences between groups in PA or adiposity over time. However, both groups significantly increased time spent in moderate-to vigorous PA (MVPA) and steps counts per day, and reduced percent body fat from baseline to 6-months. Increases in step counts per day, but not MVPA, were associated with decreases in BMI (r = -0.43, p < 0.01) and percent body fat (r = -0.30, p < 0.05). Conclusion: Increases in volume of PA but not intensity (MVPA) was associated with reductions in adiposity. Although more intensive behavioural trials may be needed, intervening with day care providers to increase PA, especially volume of PA, may be a feasible and effective method of reducing adiposity in the early years.",The Preschoolers Activity Trial (PAT): A randomized controlled trial evaluating the effects of physical activity on adiposity in the early years,https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Preschoolers+Activity+Trial+(PAT):+A+randomized+controlled+trial+evaluating+the+effects+of+physical+activity+on+adiposity+in+the+early+years,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA NA NA

3030683,Rest of Europe,Primary/Elementary,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"The development of CVD risk factors carries a behavioral component that may be corrected at an early age, when behaviors are first formed, by effective health promotion initiatives. School-based interventions are an effective way to promote healthy behaviors, specially when they also reach out to the children's most proximal environment: their families, teachers and the school itself. Within this framework, the first phase of the long-term Program SI! intervention targets children from 3 to 5 years of age aiming to establish appropriate lifestyle behaviors early in life. The intervention entails a comprehensive approach including four lifestyle-related components: correct dietary habits, promotion of physical activity, understanding how the human body and heart work, and emotion's management. To evaluate the efficacy of the Program SI! to instill healthy behaviors in children aged 3-5, a cluster-randomized controlled trial in public schools in the city of Madrid (Spain) was initiated in 2011. A total 24 schools were selected on the basis of socio-demographic characteristics. These included 2062 children (3-5 years), 1949 families, and 125 teachers at baseline. Schools were randomized (1:1) to follow their usual school curriculum or to engage in the intervention. The primary outcome of this report is the 2-years differential change from baseline in scores for knowledge, attitudes and habits (KAH) in the four components of the intervention between intervention and control. Children were interviewed by trained psychologists and scored on overall and component-specific KAH questionnaires. The Test for Emotional Comprehension (TEC) was used to assess children's ability to recognize emotions. Mixed linear models accounting for the cluster-randomized design were used to test for intervention effects. Fixed effects in each model were the corresponding baseline score, the class year, and the treatment group. Schools were handled as random effects. After 2 years, the Program SI! intervention increased children's overall KAH score (5.6, 95%CI, 4.1-7.1, p<0.001) corresponding to an additional 7% improvement in the intervened children. KAH assessing improved Physical activity contributed the most (3.39, 95%CI, 2.35-4.43, p<0.001) to the difference between groups, followed by KAH relating Dietary habits (1.78, 95%CI, 0.94-2.62, p<0.001). A weak, non-significant improvement in KAH score for Human body (0.37, 95%CI, -0.14-0.89) was also found. Regarding emotion's management, this component also increased after the intervention (0.50, 95%CI, 0.02-0.97, p<0.040), with greater improvements in older children (5 years old).

While there is a growing body of research which suggests that student understanding is enhanced by inquiry-based teaching, only recently have studies begun to use experimental designs. This study attempts to answer the following questions: (1) To what extent can differences in student learning between the inquiry-based and commonplace groups be attributed to randomized group assignment?; (2) What differences in achievement by treatment group exist specific to the learning goals of knowledge, reasoning, and argumentation?; and (3) Does student race/ethnicity, gender, or socio-economic status account for variation in posttest scores above and beyond variation accounted for by pretest scores and group assignment? The study participants came from 24 schools from seven districts from across a range of urban, suburban, and rural areas; five of the students attended private schools and two were home-schooled. The authors use the Horizon Research Inc. survey and interview data (Weiss et al., 2003 and Hudson, McMahon & Overstreet, 2002) to define 'commonplace teaching', and use The Biological Sciences Curriculum Study (BSCS) 5E instructional model, or the '5Es' (Bybee, 1997) to organize the inquiry-based unit. This study found that students in an inquiry-based classroom reached significantly higher levels of achievement than students experiencing commonplace teaching. The superior effectiveness of the inquiry-based instruction was consistent across a range of learning goals (knowledge, scientific reasoning, and argumentation) and types of measures (dichotomous items, open-response items, and clinical interviews). This study therefore contributes to the growing body of evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of inquiry-based teaching; supports the claims about inquiry in national science education reform documents (e.g. AAAS, 1993, 2000; NRC, 1996, 2000); and refutes the claims made by Kirshner, Sweller & Clark (2006) in response to the findings by Klahr and colleagues (Chen & Klahr, 1999; Klahr & Nigam, 2004).

The sample consisted of a total of 96 students (9th through 12th grade) ranging in age from 13-17 in special education reading and English classrooms. Participants included students with learning disabilities (LD), dyslexia, or students selected as students with significant reading difficulties. The investigator paired students on variables of interest (i.e., reading level) within classes and then randomly assigned pairs to one of three groups: repeated reading (N=33), wide reading (N=34), or typical instruction (N=29). Tutors, trained by the investigator, monitored students as they worked in pairs in each treatment condition. Intervention was provided daily for approximately 15-20 minutes for 10 weeks. Treatment effects for each outcome measure were estimated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Results indicate no overall statistically significant differences for any condition. Effects ranged from -.81 to .28 usually hovering around no effect or favoring the C condition over the treatment conditions or favoring the RR condition over the WR condition. Five separate ANCOVAs were conducted using the following dependent variables with each pretest score used as a covariate: (1) Woodcock Johnson Tests of Achievement III (WJIII) Passage Comprehension subtest (RR vs. C = -.10; WR vs. C = -.20; RR vs. WR= .10); (2) Test of Silent Reading Fluency (TOSRE) (RR vs. C = .-31; WR vs. C = -.81; RR vs. WR= .10); (3) Woodcock Johnson Tests of Achievement III (WJIII) Letter-Word Identification subtest (RR vs. C = -.05; WR vs. C = -.11; RR vs.WR = .06); (4) AIMSWeb Oral Reading Fluency System (RR vs. C = -.08; WR vs. C = -.26; RR vs. WR= .18); and (5) Test of Silent Contextual Reading Fluency (RR vs. C =.28; WR vs. C = -.01; RR vs. WR= .28).

The intervention took the form of a randomized experiment, in which Treatment pupils were presented with data on their own misperceptions regarding cigarette smoking among their peers, followed by group discussions about normative misperceptions. Follow-up (n = 349) was conducted a year after intervention. Results. Significant differences between Treatment and Control in misperceptions were found, not only regarding smoking, but also regarding alcohol intake and drug misuse. No significant differences were found in actual smoking prevalence, but other types of risk behavior, including different types of criminal offenses, were significantly less prevalent in the Treatment group, as were the numbers of self-reported situations in which pupils had given in to (imagined) peer pressure. Conclusion. The experiment demonstrated the existence of a ripple effect: the correction of misperceptions regarding one type of risk behavior influenced other types of misperceptions and risk behaviors as well. It is hypothesized that an important contributory factor to the success of the experiment is the absence of any moral judgment in the intervention.

A first objective was to investigate whether individual level variation of on-task behavior moderated the impact of a universal preventive intervention, the Good Behavior Game (GBG), on aggression development, controlling for classroom levels of on-task behavior. The second goal was to study whether improved on-task behavior or reductions in peer rejection mediated intervention impact on children's aggression. Second-grade classrooms were randomly assigned to the GBG or a control condition. Results showed that intervention impact was found only among children who had low-level on-task behavior at baseline. These children showed a decrease in aggression when in the GBG condition, which was not found among control group children. The reduction in aggression among low on-task children was mediated by reductions in peer rejection. No mediation effect of on-task behavior was found. These results suggest that the effect of a universal preventive intervention may depend upon initial levels of on-task behavior and that improvements in social relations with peers may explain the reductions in aggression among these low-on task children.

The 56 participating children had poor phoneme awareness, and as such, were at risk of having difficulty acquiring reading skills. Children were randomly assigned to one of three training conditions: invented spelling, phoneme segmentation, or storybook reading. All children participated in 16 small group sessions over 8 weeks. In addition, children in the three training conditions received letter-knowledge training and worked on the same 40 stimulus words that were created from an array of 14 letters. The findings were clear: on pretest, there were no differences between the three conditions on measures of early literacy and vocabulary, but, after training, invented spelling children learned to read more words than did the other children. As expected, the phoneme-segmentation and invented-spelling children were better on phoneme awareness than were the storybook-reading children. Most interesting, however, both the invented spelling and the phoneme-segmentation children performed similarly on phoneme awareness suggesting that the differential effect on learning to read was not due to phoneme awareness per se. As such, the findings support the view that invented spelling is an exploratory process that involves the integration of phoneme and orthographic representations. With guidance and developmentally appropriate feedback, invented spelling provides a milieu for children to explore the relation between oral language and written symbols that can facilitate their entry in reading.",The Role of Invented Spelling on Learning to Read in Low-Phoneme Awareness Kindergartners: A Randomized-Control-Trial Study,https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Role+of+Invented+Spelling+on+Learning+to+Read+in+Low-Phoneme+Awareness+Kindergartners:+A+Randomized-Control-Trial+Study,2011,Targeted,External Educators,Between Half and Full Term,none,none,Single,56,NA,Yes,Some Sub-Groups Reported,Immediate Post-Test Only,Yes,"Yes, Limited","Yes, Theoretical Perspectives",Yes,USA/Canada Preschool/Kindergarten Literacy/English

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of a PA intervention guided by the socio-ecological model, known as SCORES (Supporting Children's Outcomes using Rewards, Exercise and Skills). Methods: The SCORES intervention was evaluated using a cluster randomized controlled trial. Participants were 460 children (54.1% girls) aged 8.5+/-0.6 years from 8 primary schools (25 classes) located in low-income communities. The socio-ecological model provided a framework for the 12-month intervention, which included the following components: teacher professional learning, student leadership workshops (including leadership accreditation and rewards, such as stickers and water bottles), PA school policy review, equipment packs, parental engagement via newsletters, PA homework and a parent evening, and community partnerships with local sporting organizations. Primary outcomes were objectively measured minutes per day of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA)(GT3X + accelerometers) and cardiorespiratory fitness (20 meter multistage fitness test). Outcomes were assessed at baseline, mid-program (6-months) and posttest (12-months). Analyses were conducted using linear mixed models, adjusted for sex, age and school class (included as a random factor). A detailed process evaluation was also conducted. Results: Eighty-four percent of participants were retained in the study after 12-months. At mid-program, there were no statistically significant between-group differences for PA or cardiorespiratory fitness. At posttest, there were statistically significant group-bytime effects for PA (adjusted mean difference, 12.2MVPAmins/day; 95% CI, 4.4-19.9, p = 0.011) and cardiorespiratory fitness (adjusted mean difference 5.3 laps; 95% CI, 2.1-8.5, p = 0.004). Overall, teachers were satisfied with the intervention (mean [SD], 4.9 [0.3]; rating scale, 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree), as were children (mean [SD], 2.7 [0.6]; rating scale, 1 = not really to 3 = a lot). On average, teachers at the intervention schools adhered to 62.9% of the recommended PE lesson structure at observation 1, 70.5% at observation 2, and 79.0% at observation 3. Discussion: The SCORES multi-component school-based intervention improved PA and fitness in children attending primary schools in low-income communities, without increasing physical education curriculum time.

Objectives To evaluate the facilitator's effect on the implementation of the COMPAS programme (Spanish acronym for Skills for Adolescents with Healthy Sexuality), a school-based HIV prevention protocol. Methods Participants were 832 Spanish scholars aged 14 to 18. Fifteen schools were randomly assigned to one of the three following schemes: COMPAS delivered by experts only; the same programme administered by experts and peers; or a control group, not exposed to any intervention. Results The experts achieved an improvement in HIV knowledge and attitudes towards HIV and condom use; however, experts associated to peers only succeeded in increasing HIV knowledge. The effect size of the changes indicated a greater positive change in the programme when applied by experts than by experts and peers. Conclusions The participation of peers as co-facilitators did not increase the efficacy of a programme delivered by experts to Spanish adolescents. Education delivered by experts was the most effective modality for reducing sexual risk.

The study was not blinded. Analysis was conducted on the intention to treat principle, allowing for clustering.RESULTS: Composite test scores were significantly higher in the intervention group (107 villages; 2364 children) than in the control group (106 villages; 2014 children) at the end of the trial (mean difference on a percentage scale 15.8; 95% CI 13.1 to 18.6; p<0.001; 0.75 Standard Deviation (SD) difference).

The program aims to integrate computers, donated by the private sector, into the teaching of language in public schools. The authors conduct a two-year randomized evaluation of the program using a sample of 97 schools and 5,201 children. Overall, the program seems to have had little effect on students' test scores and other outcomes. These results are consistent across grade levels, subjects, and gender. The main reason for these results seems to be the failure to incorporate the computers into the educational process. Although the program increased the number of computers in the treatment schools and provided training to the teachers on how to use the computers in their classrooms, surveys of both teachers and students suggest that teachers did not incorporate the computers into their curriculum.

3031092,Rest of Europe,College/University,Other School Subjects,"PURPOSE: The use of ultrasound for neuraxial blockade is a new application of technology that is rapidly becoming accepted as a standard of care. This new skill has shown to improve success, but it is a challenge to teach. To assist with teaching the use of ultrasound in regional anesthesia of the lumbar spine, we have developed an interactive educational model ( http://pie.med.utoronto.ca/vspine or http://www.usra.ca/vspine.php ). In this study, we aimed to determine whether use of this model for a two-week period would improve the performance of novice operators in determining defined landmarks during real-time ultrasound imaging of the lumbar spine. METHODS: We evaluated the educational benefit of the ultrasound module by randomly assigning 16 postgraduate first-year (PGY1) anesthesia residents to either a control group with password-protected access to only the lumbar anatomy module or to an intervention group with access to the complete module. All residents had access to the module for two weeks following a full-day workshop that is part of the university teaching program which consists of a didactic lecture on ultrasound-facilitated neuraxial anesthesia, mentored teaching on cadaveric spine dissections, and hands-on ultrasound scanning of live models. At the end of the two weeks, the performance of the residents was evaluated using a 12-item task-specific checklist while carrying out a scout scan on a live model. RESULTS: The control group had a median score of 5.5 (25(th) percentile: 4, 75(th) percentile: 18), while the intervention group had a median score of 11.5 (25(th) percentile: 8, 75(th) percentile: 12) in the task-specific checklist, with a significant difference of 6 (confidence interval 1.5 to 10.5) between groups (P = 0.021).

8154651,UK/Ireland,College/University,Professional Training,"METHODS: A prospective randomised study of 14 medical students with no prior suturing experience, randomised to 3 groups: 1) conventional teaching; 2) head-mounted display-assisted teaching and 3) head-mounted display self-learning. All were instructed in interrupted suturing followed by 15 minutes' practice. Head-mounted displays provided a 'surgeon's eye view' video demonstrating the technique, available during practice. Subsequently students undertook a practical assessment, where suturing was videoed and graded by masked assessors using a 10-point surgical skill score (1 = very poor technique, 10 = very good technique). Students completed a questionnaire assessing confidence and satisfaction.RESULTS: Suturing ability after teaching was similar between groups (P = 0.229, Kruskal-Wallis test). Median surgical skill scores were 7.5 (range 6-10), 6 (range 3-8) and 7 (range 1-7) following head-mounted display-assisted teaching, conventional teaching, and head-mounted display self-learning respectively. There was good agreement between graders regarding surgical skill scores (rho.c = 0.599, r = 0.603), and no difference in number of sutures placed between groups (P = 0.120). The head-mounted display-assisted teaching group reported greater enjoyment than those attending conventional teaching (P = 0.033).

3030740,USA/Canada,Middle/High School,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"Fuzzy-trace theory is a theory of memory, judgment, and decision making, and their development. We applied advances in this theory to increase the efficacy and durability of a multicomponent intervention to promote risk reduction and avoidance of premature pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. Seven hundred and thirty-four adolescents from high schools and youth programs in 3 states (Arizona, Texas, and New York) were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 curriculum groups: RTR (Reducing the Risk), RTR+ (a modified version of RTR using fuzzy-trace theory), and a control group. We report effects of curriculum on self-reported behaviors and behavioral intentions plus psychosocial mediators of those effects: namely, attitudes and norms, motives to have sex or get pregnant, self-efficacy and behavioral control, and gist/verbatim constructs. Among 26 outcomes, 19 showed an effect of at least 1 curriculum relative to the control group: RTR+ produced improvements for 17 outcomes and RTR produced improvements for 12 outcomes. For RTR+, 2 differences (for perceived parental norms and global benefit perception) were confined to age, gender, or racial/ethnic subgroups. Effects of RTR+ on sexual initiation emerged 6 months after the intervention, when many adolescents became sexually active. Effects of RTR+ were greater than RTR for 9 outcomes, and remained significantly greater than controls at 1-year follow-up for 12 outcomes. Consistent with fuzzy-trace theory, results suggest that by emphasizing gist representations, which are preserved over long periods and are key memories used in decision making, the enhanced intervention produced larger and more sustained effects on behavioral outcomes and psychosocial mediators of adolescent risk taking.

Whether this really improves endoscopic skills remains controversial. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of training by using an ex vivo animal gastric model on the performance of two therapeutic procedures-hemostasis and treatment of perforation. DESIGN: A randomized, single-blind study. SETTING: An experimental endoscopy center in a university hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-one gastroenterology fellows with comparable endoscopic experience. METHODS: Participants were randomized into two groups: with (T, n = 16) and without (S, n = 15) training. All fellows continued with standard endoscopic practice. Baseline skills were assessed at enrollment. All physicians in group T underwent 2 full days of a hands-on course over a 3-month period, in addition to their standard endoscopic practice. Both groups then underwent a blinded, final evaluation. Endoscopic skills were scored from 1 (best) to 5 (poorest) by two expert, blinded tutors. Outcomes of clinical hemostatic procedures also were analyzed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Successful hemostasis and successful perforation closure. RESULTS: Thirty physicians completed the study. Hemostasis results (n = 15): The number of physicians who carried out a successful hemostasis procedure increased significantly in the group with training (27% vs 73%; P = .009) but did not change in the group without training (20% vs 20%). The mean scores of injection and clipping technique improved significantly only after training. The number of clips used decreased significantly only in the group with training; the time of clipping did not change significantly in either group. Perforation results (n = 15): The number of physicians with a successful and complete perforation closure increased nearly significantly in the group with training (40% vs 73%, P = .06) as opposed to the group without training (27% vs 47%; P = .27). The procedure time decreased significantly in the group with training only. In clinical practice, fellows in group T had a significantly higher success rate with respect to hemostatic procedures (83.2%, range 67-100 vs 63.6%, range 25-100; P = .0447). The majority of participants (93%) agreed that such courses should be compulsory in gastroenterological credentials. LIMITATIONS: A retrospective analysis of clinical outcomes. Clinical outcome data were based on self-reporting of the participants.

3031210,UK/Ireland,Primary/Elementary,Literacy/English,"Background: Low levels of literacy and high levels of behaviour problems in middle childhood often co-occur. These persistent difficulties pose a risk to academic and social development, leading to social exclusion in adulthood. Although parent-training programmes have been shown to be effective in enabling parents to support their children's development, very few parent interventions offer a combination of behavioural and literacy training. Aims: This paper (1) reports on a prevention programme which aimed to tackle behaviour and literacy problems in children at the beginning of school, and (2) presents the effects of the intervention on children's literacy. Sample: One hundred and four 5- and 6-year-old children selected from eight schools in an inner city disadvantaged community in London participated in the intervention. Methods: This is a randomized control trial with pre- and post-measurements designed to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention. The behavioural intervention consisted of the 'Incredible Years' group parenting programme combined with a new programme designed to train parents to support their children's reading at home. Results: Analyses demonstrated a significant effect of the intervention on children's word reading and writing skills, as well as parents' use of reading strategies with their children. Conclusion: A structured multicomponent preventive package delivered with attention to fidelity can enable parents to support their children's reading at home and increase their literacy skills. Together with the improvement in child behaviour, these changes could improve the life chances of children in disadvantaged communities.",Training Parents to Help Their Children Read: A Randomized Control Trial,https://www.google.com/search?q=Training+Parents+to+Help+Their+Children+Read:+A+Randomized+Control+Trial,2007,Universal,External Educators,Full Academic Year or Longer,Behaviour and Social Wellbeing,None,Clustered,112,8,Yes,Some Sub-Groups Reported,Immediate Post-Test Only,Yes,"Yes, Limited","Yes, Theoretical Perspectives",No,UK/Ireland Primary/Elementary Literacy/English

Recent studies focus on teacher training as an effective way to enhance resilience in their students, and emphasize the need for additional evidence-based practice. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a short-term resilience-building teacher intervention on reducing post-traumatic distress in students in the context of exposure to recurrent rocket attacks in Israel. Methods: A quasi-experimental, cluster randomized design employing intervention and wait-list control groups was implemented with students from grades four-six (N = 563) in four schools in Acre in the aftermath of the Second Lebanon War. We assessed the students&apos; trauma exposure, posttraumatic symptoms and anxiety before and after the intervention or the wait-list condition. Results: There was a significantly (p < 0.001) greater decrease of posttraumatic symptoms and anxiety levels among the students whose teachers participated in the intervention group as compared to students whose teachers were in the wait-list control group. A multiple regression model showed that this greater decrease in posttraumatic symptoms and anxiety levels was statistically significant after controlling for demographic variables, trauma exposure and past trauma history. Conclusion: The results of this study show that the training of teachers alone in building resilience can effectively lower post-traumatic distress and anxiety in their students. The empowerment of teachers and by building upon their expertise and experience are crucial for creating sustainability in school-based interventions.",Training Teachers to Build Resilience in Children in the Aftermath of War: A Cluster Randomized Trial,https://www.google.com/search?q=Training+Teachers+to+Build+Resilience+in+Children+in+the+Aftermath+of+War:+A+Cluster+Randomized+Trial,2013,Universal,Regular Teachers/Lecturers,Between Half and Full Term,None,None,Clustered,563,4,Yes,Whole Sample Only,Immediate Post-Test Only,Yes,No,"Yes, Descriptive Theory of Change",Yes,Asia Primary/Elementary Behaviour and Social Wellbeing

3030737,USA/Canada,Multiple,Professional Training,"One way to improve struggling schools' access to effective teachers is to use selective transfer incentives. Such incentives offer bonuses for the highest-performing teachers to move into schools serving the most disadvantaged students. In this report, we provide evidence from a randomized experiment that tested whether such a policy intervention can improve student test scores and other outcomes in low-achieving schools. The intervention, known to participants as the Talent Transfer Initiative (TTI), was implemented in 10 school districts in seven states. The highest-performing teachers in each district--those who ranked in roughly the top 20 percent within their subject and grade span in terms of raising student achievement year after year (an approach known as value added)--were identified. These teachers were offered $20,000, paid in installments over a two-year period, if they transferred into and remained in designated schools that had low average test scores. The main findings from the study include: (1) The transfer incentive successfully attracted high value-added teachers to fill targeted vacancies; (2) The transfer incentive had a positive impact on test scores (math and reading) in targeted elementary classrooms; and (3) The transfer incentive had a positive impact on teacher-retention rates during the payout period; retention of the high-performing teachers who transferred was similar to their counterparts in the fall immediately after the last payout.

This study evaluates the relative efficacy of a school-based, cognitive-behavioral intervention compared to an educational-supportive treatment for adolescents with social anxiety disorder. Methods: Thirty-six students (30 females), ages 14 to 16, were randomized to a 12-week specific intervention, Skills for Social and Academic Success (SASS), or a credible attention control matched for structure and contact, conducted in school. Results: Independent evaluations and adolescent self-reports indicated significant reduction in social anxiety for SASS compared to the control group.

Objective: This pilot study addressed this issue by comparing a modular CBT for anxiety disorders to UC in a sample of 32 volunteer youth (mean age 10.28 years, 63% female, 84% African American) seen in school-based mental health programs. Methods: Youth were randomly assigned to CBT (n = 17) or UC (n = 15); independent evaluators conducted diagnostic interviews with children and parents at pre- and post-intervention, and at a one-month follow-up. Results: Based on intent-to-treat analyses, no differences were found in response rates between groups with 50 and 42% of the children in CBT, compared to 46 and 57% in UC no longer meeting criteria for an anxiety disorder at post-treatment and follow-up respectively. Similar improvements in global functioning were also found in both treatment groups. Baseline predictors of a positive treatment response included lower anxiety, fewer maladaptive thoughts, less exposure to urban hassles, and lower levels of parenting stress. Therapist use of more CBT session structure elements and greater competence in implementing these elements was also related to a positive treatment response.

3030853,Asia,Middle/High School,Behaviour and Social Wellbeing,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether participation in a mind-body skills group program based on psychological self-care, mind-body techniques, and self-expression decreases symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). METHOD: Eighty-two adolescents meeting criteria for PTSD according to the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (which corresponds with 16 of the 17 diagnostic criteria for PTSD in DSM-IV) were randomly assigned to a 12-session mind-body group program or a wait-list control group. The program was conducted by high school teachers in consultation with psychiatrists and psychologists and included meditation, guided imagery, and breathing techniques; self-expression through words, drawings, and movement; autogenic training and biofeedback; and genograms. Changes in PTSD symptoms were measured using the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire. The study was conducted from September 2004 to May 2005 by The Center for Mind-Body Medicine at a high school in the Suhareka region of Kosovo. RESULTS: Students in the immediate intervention group had significantly lower PTSD symptom scores following the intervention than those in the wait-list control group (F = 29.8, df = 1,76; p < .001). Preintervention and postintervention scores (mean [SD]) for the intervention group were 2.5 (0.3) and 2.0 (0.3), respectively, and for the control group, 2.5 (0.3) and 2.4 (0.4), respectively. The decreased PTSD symptom scores were maintained in the initial intervention group at 3-month follow-up. After the wait-list control group received the intervention, there was a significant decrease (p < .001) in PTSD symptom scores compared to the preintervention scores.

Moreover, national student assessments are recent and rigorous policy evaluation is lacking. This study presents the results of one of the first randomized controlled trials implemented in Italian schools in order to measure the effects of a professional development (PD) program for teachers on student math achievement. The program was already at scale when it was being evaluated. Objective: Assessing the effects of a PD program for math teachers on their studentsï¿½ achievement and making suggestions for future policy evaluations. Design: A large-scale clustered randomized control trial has been conducted. It involves 175 lower secondary schools (sixth - eighth grade) in four among the Italian lowest performing regions. Alongside national standard math assessments, the project collected a wide amount of information. Subjects: Math in lower secondary schools. Measures: Math achievement as measured by standardized tests provided by the National Education Assessment Institute (Istituto Nazionale per la Valutazione del Sistema di Istruzione e Formazione); teacher and student practices and attitudes collected through questionnaires. Results: Findings suggest that the program had no significant impact on math scores during the first year (when the program was held).

3031358,Asia,Middle/High School,Physical Health and Wellbeing,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of adolescent smoking has been increasing rapidly in China. Theory-based smoking prevention programmes in schools may be an effective approach in preventing smoking among Chinese adolescents. METHODS: A school-level cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted among 7th and 8th grade students (N = 2343) in four junior high schools in southern China during 2004-06. The theory-based, multi-level intervention was compared with the standard health curriculum. Outcome measures comprised changes in students' smoking-related knowledge, attitudes and behaviour. RESULTS: The mean knowledge scores from baseline to the 1- and 2-year follow-ups increased more in the intervention group than in the control group, whereas there was little change in attitude scores. At the 1-year follow-up (the total sample), the interventions reduced the probability of baseline experimental smokers' escalating to regular smoker [7.9 vs 18.3%; adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12-0.97, P = 0.043], but did not reduce the probability of baseline non-smokers' initiating smoking (7.9 vs 10.6%; adjusted OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.54-1.38, P = 0.538). At the 2-year follow-up (only 7th grade students), similar proportions of baseline non-smokers initiated smoking in the intervention group and the control group (13.5 vs 13.1%), while a possibly lower proportion of baseline experimental smokers escalated to regular smoking in the intervention group than the control group (22.6 vs 40.0%; adjusted OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.12-1.57, P = 0.199). CONCLUSIONS: This multi-level intervention programme had a moderate effect on inhibiting the escalation from experimental to regular smoking among Chinese adolescents, but had little effect on the initiation of smoking. The programme improved adolescents' smoking-related knowledge, but did not change their attitudes towards smoking.","Two-year effects of a school-based prevention programme on adolescent cigarette smoking in Guangzhou, China: a cluster randomized trial","https://www.google.com/search?q=Two-year+effects+of+a+school-based+prevention+programme+on+adolescent+cigarette+smoking+in+Guangzhou,+China:+a+cluster+randomized+trial",2010,Universal,Mixture,Full Academic Year or Longer,Behaviour and Social Wellbeing,none,Clustered,2243,4,Yes,Whole Sample Only,At Least Some Follow-Up,Yes,"Yes, Fairly Well","Yes, Theoretical Perspectives",Yes,Asia Middle/High School Physical Health and Wellbeing

Method: This cluster-randomized trial was run in 19 London schools (N = 1,024 adolescents). Trained school-based professionals delivered two 90-minute, CBT-based group interventions targeting 1 of 4 personality-risk profiles: anxiety sensitivity, hopelessness, impulsivity, or sensation seeking. Self-report depression, anxiety, and conduct disorder symptoms were assessed at 6-month intervals. Results: Interventions were associated with significantly reduced depressive, anxiety, and conduct symptoms (p < .05) over 2 years in the full sample, reduced odds of severe depressive symptoms (odds ratio [OR] = 0.74, CI = 0.58ï¿½0.96), and conduct problems (OR = 0.79, CI = 0.65ï¿½0.96), and a nonsignificant reduction in severe anxiety symptoms (OR = 0.79, CI = 0.59ï¿½1.05). Evaluating a priori personality-specific hypotheses revealed strong evidence for impulsivity-specific effects on severe conduct problems, modest evidence of anxiety sensitivityï¿½specific effects on severe anxiety, and no evidence for hopelessness-specific effects on severe depressive symptoms.

controlled trial with intervention and control condition
(school as usual). OVK was based on the Penn Resiliency
Program (PRP) (Gillham et al. Psychological Science, 6,
343–351, 1995). Depressive symptoms were assessed with
the Child Depression Inventory (Kovacs 2001). In total, 1341
adolescents participated,Mage=13.91, SD=0.55, 47.3%girls,
83.1 % Dutch ethnicity; intervention group n=655, four
schools; control group n=735, five schools. Intent-to-treat
analyses revealed that OVK did not prevent depressive symptoms,
β= −0.01, SE=0.05, p=.829, Cohen’s d=0.02, and the
prevalence of an elevated level of depressive symptoms was
not different between groups at 1 year follow-up, OR=1.00,
95 % CI=0.60–1.65, p=.992, NNT=188. Latent Growth
Curve Modeling over the 2 year follow-up period showed that
OVK did not predict differences in depressive symptoms immediately
following intervention, intercept: β=0.02, p=.642,
or changes in depressive symptoms, slope: β= −0.01, p=.919.
No moderation by gender or baseline depressive symptoms
was found. To conclude, OVK was not effective in preventing
depressive symptoms across the 2 year follow-up. The implications
of these findings are discussed.","Universal School-Based Depression Prevention ‘Op Volle

The school curriculum, 'Unplugged,' is based on social influence approach and addresses social and personal skills, knowledge, and normative beliefs. It consists of 12 one-hour interactive sessions delivered by teachers. Its effectiveness was evaluated through a randomized trial involving 7,079 pupils of seven European countries. 'Unplugged' was effective in reducing cigarette smoking, episodes of drunkenness, and the use of cannabis at short term. This association, however, was confined to boys, with age and self-esteem as possible explanations of this difference. Beneficial effects associated with the program persisted at fifteen-month follow-up for drunkenness, alcohol-related problems, and cannabis use, and were stronger among adolescents in schools of average low socioeconomic level.

8155241,Asia,Middle/High School,Other School Subjects,"The aim of this study is to apply the jigsaw technique in Social Sciences teaching and to unroll the
effects of this technique on learning. The unit “Science within Time” in the secondary 7th grade Social
Sciences text book was chosen for the research. It is aimed to compare the jigsaw technique with the
traditional teaching method in teaching of the unit. The sampling of the research was conducted with
total of 53 students, in two different classes, studying in 7th grade of a secondary school located in the
Erzurum province of Turkey during 2014 to 2015 academic years. Pre-test/Post-test control group
design was used as a method in the research (Karasar, 2006). A control group was formed with
students randomly picked from both classes, and the rest of the students were the experimental group.
While the lessons were taught to the control group using the traditional teaching method, cooperative
learning technique (jigsaw technique) was used on the experimental group. The lessons were taught to
the control and experimental group by the researcher. To determine prior knowledge of students’ in
both groups, Prior Knowledge Test (PKT) was given, and Science within Time Achievement Test
(swtAT) was administered to identify their conceptual understanding in the unit “Science within Time”.
Later, Jigsaw Opinion Scale (JOS) was given to the students in the experimental group and their
opinions on the implementation of jigsaw technique were identified. At the end of the research, to
determine students’ achievement, swtAT was administered to all of the students (control and
experimental group) again as the post-test and the same test was applied again as the retention test to
examine the retention of knowledge after eleven weeks. The achievement level of students obtained
from both the traditional teaching method and cooperative learning using jigsaw technique was
compared with this research. When the statistical analysis of the research is examined, the
achievement level of students in the unit “Science within Time”, which was taught with the jigsaw
technique, has a significant difference in favor of the experimental group.","Use of jigsaw technique to teach the unit ""science

3031816,USA/Canada,Middle/High School,Behaviour and Social Wellbeing,"School bullying and delinquent behaviors are persistent and pervasive problems for schools, and have lasting effects for all individuals involved (Copeland et al., 'JAMA Psychiatry' 70:419-426, 2013; Espelage et al., 'J Res Adolesc' 24(2):337-349, 2013a). As a result, policymakers and practitioners have attempted to thwart these ill-effects using school-based interventions. Recent meta-analyses have found, however, that these programs produce only moderate effects (Ttofi and Farrington, 'J Exp Criminol' 7:27-56, 2011). Consequently, it is important to investigate further the reasons for such findings. One promising analysis is to assess the relation between treatment intensity variables and program outcomes. Unfortunately, few treatment intensity variables have been utilized in the school-based prevention literature, and it is often cumbersome to model the relation between treatment intensity and outcomes. The purpose of this project, therefore, is to explicate novel measures of treatment intensity and delineate a relatively new meta-analytic technique to model the relation between the variables and program effects. The context for this project is a large-scale, multi-site, cluster-randomized trial; 36 schools and 3,616 students participated in three waves of data collection. The results indicated that, for the second wave of data collection, stronger treatment effects were found when teachers and program implementers spent a greater amount of time prepping lessons, provided additional financial resources, and received outside consultation and support.",Using a Meta-Analytic Technique to Assess the Relationship between Treatment Intensity and Program Effects in a Cluster-Randomized Trial,https://www.google.com/search?q=Using+a+Meta-Analytic+Technique+to+Assess+the+Relationship+between+Treatment+Intensity+and+Program+Effects+in+a+Cluster-Randomized+Trial,2014,Universal,Regular Teachers/Lecturers,Full Academic Year or Longer,None,None,Clustered,3616,36,Yes,Whole Sample Only,Immediate Post-Test Only,Yes,No,"Yes, Descriptive Theory of Change",Yes,USA/Canada Middle/High School Behaviour and Social Wellbeing

This is an action research study that employs an embedded mixed methods design model, involving both quantitative and qualitative data. The study is guided by the critical design ethnography theoretical lens: an ethnographic process involving participatory design work aimed at transforming a local context while producing an instructional design that can be used in multiple contexts. The impact of an immersive 3D multi-user web-based educational simulation game on a cohort of fifth-grade students was examined on multiple levels of assessments??ï¿½immediate, close, proximal and distal. A survey instrument was used to assess students??ï¿½ self-efficacy in technology and scientific inquiry. Science content mastery was assessed at the immediate (participation in game play), close (engagement in-game reports) and proximal (understanding of targeted concepts) levels; scientific reasoning was assessed at the distal (domain general critical thinking test) level. This quasi-experimental study used a convenient sampling method. Seven regular fifth-grade classes participated in this study. Three of the classes were the control group and the other four were the intervention group. A cohort of 165 students participated in this study. The treatment group contained 38 boys and 52 girls, and the control group contained 36 boys and 39 girls. Two-tailed t-test, Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA), and Pearson Correlation were used to analyze data. The data supported the rejection of the null hypothesis for the three research questions. The correlational analyses showed strong relationship among three of the four variables. There were no correlations between gender and the three dependent variables. The findings of this study support the hypothesis that the intervention group students will obtain dramatically larger gains on the three measures: Cornell Critical Thinking Test, Curriculum-Oriented Test, and the Self-Efficacy in Technology and Science (SETS) survey.","Using a multi-user virtual simulation to promote science content: Mastery, scientific reasoning, and academic self-efficacy in fifth grade science","https://www.google.com/search?q=Using+a+multi-user+virtual+simulation+to+promote+science+content:+Mastery,+scientific+reasoning,+and+academic+self-efficacy+in+fifth+grade+science",2016,Universal,External Educators,More than One Term,None,None,Single,165,NA,Yes,Some Sub-Groups Reported,Immediate Post-Test Only,Yes,"Yes, Fairly Well","Yes, Theoretical Perspectives",Yes,USA/Canada Primary/Elementary Other School Subjects

Sample One hundred and twenty-eight consented high school students in 15 classes. Methods Students completed daily warm-ups over a 4-week period. Students were randomly assigned to conditions within classrooms. Warm-ups were independently completed at the start of class meetings and consisted of questions about content covered 1-10 days prior to each warm-up. Students received feedback on their answers each week. A series of ANOVAs and ANCOVAs was conducted. Results and Conclusions Results showed equal and significant growth from pre- to post-test for both conditions (d = .31-.67) on three outcomes: Biology knowledge, biology diagram comprehension (near transfer), and geology diagram comprehension (far transfer). ANCOVA results suggested that the magnitude of this increase was linked to the number of questions attempted during the intervention. For the DBR condition only, there were interactions with content knowledge on diagram comprehension gain scores and interactions with spatial scores on biology knowledge gain scores.

This study evaluated the impact of one SECD program, Positive Action (PA), on educational outcomes among low-income, urban youth. Methods: The longitudinal study used a matched-pair, cluster-randomized controlled design. Student-reported disaffection with learning and academic grades, and teacher ratings of academic ability and motivation were assessed for a cohort followed from grades 3 to 8. Aggregate school records were used to assess standardized test performance (for entire school, cohort, and demographic subgroups) and absenteeism (entire school). Multilevel growth-curve analyses tested program effects. Results: PA significantly improved growth in academic motivation and mitigated disaffection with learning. There was a positive impact of PA on absenteeism and marginally significant impact on math performance of all students. There were favorable program effects on reading for African American boys and cohort students transitioning between grades 7 and 8, and on math for girls and low-income students. Conclusions: A school-based SECD program was found to influence academic outcomes among students living in low-income, urban communities.

Medical schools are now adopting similar competency frameworks. We investigated whether a Web-based program could effectively teach and assess elements of systems-based practice. METHODS: We enrolled 276 medical students and 417 residents in the fields of surgery, medicine, obstetrics-gynecology, and emergency medicine in a 9-week randomized, controlled, crossover educational trial. Participants were asked to sequentially complete validated Web-based modules on patient safety and the US health care system. The primary outcome measure was performance on a 26-item validated online test administered before, between, and after the participants completed the modules. RESULTS: Six hundred forty (92.4%) of the 693 enrollees participated in the study; 512 (80.0%) of the participants completed all 3 tests. Participants' test scores improved significantly after completion of the first module (P<.001).

SETTING: Rehabilitation center. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-two students in a university undergraduate OT program. INTERVENTIONS: All students received the standard university curriculum. The 22 second-year students, randomly allocated to the Wheelchair Skills Training Program (WSTP) group, were also trained (on a single occasion each, in groups of 1-3 at a time) on the 50 skills that make up the WSTP. The mean +/- standard deviation (SD) training time was 121.2+/-33.5 minutes per group. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Total percentage score on the Wheelchair Skills Test (WST), Version 2.4. RESULTS: From before to after intervention, second-year students in the WSTP group increased their mean percentage WST scores +/- SD from 64.8%+/-9.0% to 81.0%+/-5.2%, a 25% improvement (P<.001). Over a comparable period, the 18 students in the second-year control group increased from 66.0%+/-8.0% to 72.4%+/-7.1%, a 9.7% improvement (P=.015).

Ninety students aged 14ï¿½15 years participated in either an experimental life skills program integrated in a multisport PE setting, or traditional PE. Prior to and after the intervention, they were administered tests assessing physical fitness (aerobic and muscular), sport skills (passing and dribbling), and executive functions (inhibition and working memory updating). Furthermore, they were evaluated in goal setting knowledge, self-efficacy in sport-relevant life skills (problem solving, self-regulation, communication, and social skills), and decision making and tactical cooperation skills in sport game situations. The results showed that (a) the life skills program induced improvements in aerobic fitness, sport passing skill, and inhibitory executive function compared with the control group, and (b) fitness and sport skill outcomes were mediated by gains in life skills operationalized as behavioral change in decision making skill. Thus, life skills training in a designed sport education context seems beneficial to the fitness dimension of physical health and the cognitive dimension of mental health.

behavior problems, juvenile delinquency, truancy, unemployment, jail time, and
substance abuse. Reading difficulties are common in the educational setting, afflicting
anywhere from 20-40 percent of students. Read Naturally is a computer-based reading
program which targets the third ""big idea"" (i.e„ accuracy and fluency with reading). The
current study assessed the efficacy of the Read Naturally program in second through
fourth grade elementary students in a public elementary school. Additionally, this study
assessed whether improving reading abilities resulted in changes in classroom behavior
problems or self-esteem. Eighty-two students from a small, public elementary school who
were in need of additional reading support, according to the DIBELS Benchmark
Assessments, participated in the current study. Students were matched on DIBELS
scores, grade, race, and gender and then randomly assigned to either the Read Naturally
condition or the Education as Usual condition. Students used the Read Naturally program
for 30-45 minutes each day, five days a week, for eight weeks. Results suggested that,
throughout the 16 weeks of intervention, significant improvements were generally seen
on all of the reading measures over time, regardless of the condition to which students
were assigned, although small effect sizes generally favored the Read Naturally
intervention. Additionally, students in higher grades generally demonstrated more
improvement on the WJ-III Summary Scores, WJ-III Passage Comprehension subscale,
and the WJ-III Word Attack subscale, regardless of the condition to which they were
assigned. Student measures suggest that Read Naturally does not result in increased selfesteem,
even with improvements in academic performance. Behavior measures were
inconclusive. Generally, the effects of the Read Naturally intervention appear discernible,
but not incremental, suggesting that Read Naturally may not be more efficacious than
typical education, but may have benefits in terms of targeting larger groups of students,
being individualized to each student, and may allow another way for teachers to target the
third ""big idea."" Future research is warranted.

and literacy skills to succeed in kindergarten. The type of curriculum that is available
within pre-kindergarten settings can impact children’s academic readiness. This work
presents results from an evaluation of two language and literacy curricula (i.e., Let’s
Begin with the Letter People and Doors to Discovery) from a random assignment study
that occurred within three settings (i.e., Head Start, Title 1, and universal pre-kindergarten)
and included a control group. The design included a mentoring and nonmentoring
condition that was balanced across sites in either curriculum condition. A
pre and post-test design was utilized in the analyses, with children (n = 603) tested
before the intervention and at the end of the year. Multilevel growth curve modeling,
where the child outcomes (dependent measures) are modeled as a function of the
child’s level of performance and rate of growth between pre and post-testing, was used
for all analyses. Results indicated that in many key language/literacy areas, the skills
of children in classrooms using either one of the target curricula grew at greater rates
than children in control classrooms. This was especially true in the Head Start
programs. The findings from this study indicate that at-risk children can benefit from
a well-specified curriculum. Additionally, findings demonstrate that a well-detailed
curriculum appeared to be less important for children from higher income families.

being measured and type of program.","An evaluation of curriculum, setting, and mentoring

means to promote first-grade students' comprehension of central story elements
in children's literature. Participants were 74 children in four first-grade classrooms,
which were randomly assigned to one of four groups: (a) a Story Mapping
1 (SM1) group, in which students were taught to construct story maps for
unadapted, unabridged children's stories they had read; (b) a Story Mapping 2
(SM2) group, which involved the same instruction as SM1 but included using

comparison strategy group, in which students read the same stories according to a
predict-verify procedure; or (d) a directed reading activity (DRA) instructed control
group, in which students engaged in a noninteractive, guided reading of stories.
Quantitative analyses were conducted on five whole-sample dependent
measures: an important idea test on a parsed story, a wh-question test of central
story elements, a summary selection task, an important story element recognition
test, and a delayed wh-question test. Results revealed that (a) some form of active
comprehension instruction (SM1, SM2, or DRTA) was superior to the controlgroup
DRA on most measures, (b) story mapping (SMI and SM2) students consistently
outperformed DRA controls, (c) story mapping was superior to DRTA on
some measures but not on others, and (d) SM1 and SM2 groups did not differ on
any measure. Qualitative data from student interviews generally supported these
findings. It was concluded that instruction in story mapping is an effective instructional
strategy for promoting first-grade students' ability to identify central

W085,USA/Canada,Primary/Elementary,Literacy/English,"Although there is arguably substantial evidence in the literature on what works for students at risk of reading failure, the evidence on effective interventions for English-language learners (ELs) is rather meager. Moreover, there are limited curriculum programs and instructional materials available to support schools in the inclusion of ELs in reading-reform efforts. This study examined the efficacy of a systematic transition intervention designed to increase the early literacy achievement of Spanish-speaking ELs in transitional bilingual programs. The intervention included a set of 12 scripted transition lessons that made explicit for ELs the orthographic, lexical, and syntactic differences between Spanish and English. In addition, the lessons addressed the story content knowledge and vocabulary and academic language necessary to ensure that ELs could access the English literacy curriculum and classroom discourse. Seventy-eight first-grade ELs identified as at risk for reading difficulty were randomly assigned to receive either the transition lessons in the treatment condition or the standard school-based intervention
v
in the control condition. Students in both conditions received 60 thirty-minute sessions of small-group instruction as a supplement to their first-grade core reading program. Instruction in both conditions was explicit and focused on the core reading components (i.e., phonemic awareness, phonics, word work, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension). Student performance was measured on the following dimensions of early reading: (a) phonemic decoding and word reading, (b) oral reading fluency, (c) vocabulary development, and (d) comprehension. In addition, fidelity of implementation, time devoted to the different literacy components, and feasibility of implementation data were collected during and after the study.
A gain-score analysis was employed in this study to compare the effect of the treatment (transition lessons) and control (standard school-based intervention) conditions on scores obtained from the pretest and posttest measures of reading achievement. The results indicated that the difference in gain scores between the treatment and control conditions was not statistically significant on any of the measures utilized in the study. Therefore, the transition intervention did not appear to be more effective than the typical school-based intervention. Findings are discussed in light of current research on improving the academic performance of ELs.","EXAMINING THE EFFECT OF AN OVERT TRANSITION INTERVENTION ON

An intervention was designed to enhance fifth graders’ academic vocabulary. The meanings of academically
useful words were taught together with strategies for using information from context, from morphology, from
knowledge about multiple meanings, and from cognates to infer word meaning. Among the principles underlying
the intervention were that new words should be encountered in meaningful text, that native Spanish speakers should
have access to the text’s meaning through Spanish, that words should be encountered in varying contexts, and that
word knowledge involves spelling, pronunciation, morphology, and syntax as well as depth of meaning. Fifth
graders in the intervention group showed greater growth than the comparison group on knowledge of the words
taught, on depth of vocabulary knowledge, on understanding multiple meanings, and on reading comprehension.
The intervention effects were as large for the English-language learners (ELLs) as for the English-only speakers

W244,USA/Canada,Primary/Elementary,Literacy/English,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of explicit story structure
instruction on below-average fourth- and fifth-grade readers' narrative writing performance.
The students were randomly assigned to either an Explicit Story Structure
Instruction (ESSI) condition or Story Structure Awareness Instruction (SSAI) condition.
Instructional time and materials were consistent across the two conditions.
The ESSI consisted of four steps: Introduction, Examples, Teacher Modeling, and
Teacher-Guided Story Generation. The SSAI consisted of two steps: Introduction
and Examples. The ESSI was designed to provide more explicit instruction in the
application of story structure grammar to the composition of original stories, while
the SSAI provided less explicit instruction designed to inform and develop students'
awareness of story structure grammar and application to the composition of original
stories. Prior research has documented positive effects for students receiving story
structure training as compared to students receiving drama and word study training,
for both reading comprehension and writing performance. A major question that
has not been addressed in prior research is whether below-average students profit
significantly more from explicit instruction, or do they simply need training in story
structure awareness? In this study, after three Instructional sessions, the ESSI
students and SSAI students participated in a narrative story writing task. The stories
were scored with respect to story structure complexity and presence of story
structure elements. The results suggest that Explicit Story Structure Instruction
positively influenced the narrative writing performance of fourth- and fifth-grade

Specifically, SBI emphasizes the role of the mathematical structure of problems and also provides students with a heuristic to aid and self-monitor problem solving. Further, SBI addresses well-articulated problem solving strategies and supports flexible use of the strategies based on the problem situation. One hundred forty eight seventh-grade students and their teachers participated in a 10-day intervention on learning to solve ratio and proportion word problems, with classrooms randomly assigned to SBI or a control condition. Results suggested that students in SBI treatment classes outperformed students in control classes on a problem solving measure, both at posttest and on a delayed posttest administered four months later.

W368,USA/Canada,Middle/High School,Other School Subjects,"Students’ beliefs that success in science depends on exceptional talent negatively impact their motivation
to learn. For example, such beliefs have been shown to be a major factor steering students away from
taking science and math courses in high school and college. In the present study, we tested a novel
story-based instruction that models how scientists achieve through failures and struggles. We designed
this instruction to challenge this belief, thereby improving science learning in classroom settings. A
demographically diverse group of 402 9th and 10th grade students read 1 of 3 types of stories about
eminent scientists that described how the scientists (a) struggled intellectually (e.g., made mistakes in
investigating scientific problems, and overcame the mistakes through effort), (b) struggled in their
personal life (e.g., suffered family poverty and lack of parental support but overcame it), or (c) made great
discoveries (a control condition, similar to the instructional material that appears in many science
textbooks, that did not describe any struggles). Results showed that participation in either of the struggle
story conditions improved science learning postintervention, relative to that of students in the control
condition. Additionally, the effect of our intervention was more pronounced for low-performing students.
Moreover, far more students in either of the struggle story conditions felt connected to the stories and
scientists than did students in the control condition. The use of struggle stories provides a promising and
implementable instructional approach that can improve student motivation and academic performance in
science and perhaps other subjects as well.","Even Einstein Struggled: Effects of Learning About Great Scientists’

Assessment Reporting System (PARS) for the Ohio Graduation Tests (OGT). The PARS program included
several new OGT test score reports for teachers, administrators, students, and parents along with two new
websites for educators and students. The new PARS test score reports and associated websites are designed to
provide teachers, administrators, students and parents with more detailed information about student
performance as well as numerous suggestions and resources for improving performance. One of the primary
goals of PARS is to increase student motivation to pass the OGT and graduate high school. ODE hopes that
by providing clear and detailed information to each student about his or her performance relative to the state
standards, along with resources for improving performance and planning for the future, PARS may lead to
improvements in student attitudes and behaviors that are fundamental to success in high school and beyond.
Research suggests that grades or scores in the absence of constructive feedback can have a detrimental effect
on student achievement (Butler 1987; 1988). The PARS reports are designed to provide this kind of detailed
constructive feedback. Furthermore, by providing clear and detailed information to teachers and
administrators about student performance, along with tools for making sense of the data and resources for
improving and targeting instruction, PARS has the potential to inform numerous aspects of instruction.
This research report presents program evaluation findings from the first-year pilot of PARS. The primary goals
for the evaluation were to (a) document the implementation of the program and (b) provide scientifically
based evidence of potential impacts on instruction and student learning. The evaluation involved a district
random assignment design and a mixed-methods approach to measuring program implementation and
impacts. A total of 100 high schools in 60 school districts participated in this research, with 51 schools in 30
districts randomly assigned to participate in the PARS pilot during the 2006–07 school year. A subsample of 5
schools agreed to site visits during which researchers conducted interviews with teachers and students to learn
more about PARS.","A Randomized Evaluation of Ohio's Personalized

W471,USA/Canada,Primary/Elementary,Literacy/English,"Vocabulary knowledge at school entry is a robust predictor of later reading achievement.Many
children begin formal reading instruction at a significant disadvantage due to low levels of
vocabulary. Until recently, relatively few research studies examined the efficacy of vocabulary
interventions for children in the early primary grades (e.g., before fourth grade), and even fewer
addressed vocabulary intervention for students at increased risk for reading failure. In more
recent work, researchers have begun to explore ways in which to diminish the “meaningful
differences” in language achievement noted among children as they enter formal schooling.
This article provides a review of a particularly effective model of vocabulary intervention
based on shared storybook reading and situates this model in a context of tiered intervention,
an emerging model of instructional design in the field of special education. In addition, we
describe a quasi-experimental posttest-only study that examines the feasibility and effectiveness
of the model for first-grade students. Participants were 224 first-grade students of whom 98
were identified as at risk for reading disability based on low levels of vocabulary. Results
of a multivariate analysis of variance revealed significant differences on measures of target
vocabulary knowledge at the receptive and context level, suggesting that students at risk for
reading failure benefit significantly from a second tier of vocabulary instruction. Implications
for classroom practice as well as future research are provided.","A Tiered Intervention Model for Early Vocabulary Instruction: The Effects

data collection, we evaluated two approaches for teaching comprehension strategies to 7- and 8-year-old children in
four second-grade classrooms using science information texts. The first approach focused upon explicitly teaching
a series of single comprehension strategies, one-at-a-time (SSI). The second approach focused on teaching a
“set” or “family” of transacted comprehension strategies within a collaborative, interactive and engaging routine
(TSI). Results showed no difference between teaching young children a “set” of comprehension strategies and
teaching comprehension strategies explicitly, one-at-a-time on their reading comprehension performance as
measured by a standardized test of reading comprehension, recall of main ideas from reading two 200 word
passages from information texts, a reading motivation survey and a strategy use survey. Results showed significant
differences between students taught a set of comprehension strategies on measures of elaborated knowledge
acquisition from reading science books (detail idea units recalled), retention of science content knowledge,
and significantly improved criterion or curriculum-based reading comprehension test scores. These benefits
favoring TSI over SSI are important because the learning curve is relatively steep for teachers to develop the
ability to teach and for young children to develop the ability to coordinate a “set” of transacted comprehension
strategies.","An evaluation of two approaches for teaching reading

Unlike in past studies, many students did not begin the study with equation-solving skills, and prior

algebraic methods at pretest benefited most from studying examples sequentially or comparing problem
types, rather than from comparing solution methods. Students who attempted algebraic methods at pretest
learned more from comparing solution methods. Students may need sufficient prior knowledge in a
domain before they benefit from comparing alternative solution methods. These findings are in line with

W497,USA/Canada,Middle/High School,Numeracy/Maths,"Background. A key learning outcome in problem-solving domains is the development
of procedural flexibility, where learners know multiple procedures and use them
appropriately to solve a range of problems (e.g., Verschaffel, Luwel, Torbeyns, & Van
Dooren, 2009). However, students often fail to become flexible problem solvers in
mathematics. To support flexibility, teaching standards in many countries recommend
that students be exposed to multiple procedures early in instruction and be encouraged
to compare them.
Aims. We experimentally evaluated this recommended instructional practice for
supporting procedural flexibility during a classroom lesson, relative to two alternative
conditions. The alternatives reflected the common instructional practice of delayed
exposure to multiple procedures, either with or without comparison of procedures.
Sample. Grade 8 students from two public schools (N = 198) were randomly
assigned to condition. Students had not received prior instruction onmulti-step equation
solving, which was the topic of our lessons.
Method. Students learned about multi-step equation solving under one of three
conditions in math class for about 3 hr. They also completed a pre-test, post-test,
and 1-month-retention test on their procedural knowledge, procedural flexibility, and
conceptual knowledge of equation solving.
Results. Novices who compared procedures immediately were more flexible
problem solvers than those who did not, even on a 1-month retention test. Although
condition had limited direct impact on conceptual and procedural knowledge, greater
flexibility was associated with greater knowledge of both types.
Conclusions. Comparing procedures can support flexibility in novices and early
introduction to multiple procedures may be one important reason.","Developing procedural flexibility: Are novices

W501,USA/Canada,Middle/High School,Numeracy/Maths,"Most mathematics assignments consist of a group of problems requiring the same strategy. For example, a lesson on the quadratic formula is typically followed by a block of problems requiring students to use the quadratic formula, which means that students know the appropriate strategy before they read each problem. In an alternative approach, different kinds of problems appear in an interleaved order, which requires students to choose the strategy on the basis of the problem itself. In the classroom-based experiment reported here, grade seven students (n = 140) received blocked or interleaved practice over a nine-week period, followed two weeks later by an unannounced test. Mean test scores were greater for material learned by interleaved practice rather than by blocked practice (72% vs. 38%, d = 1.05). This interleaving effect was observed even though the different kinds of problems were superficially dissimilar from each other, whereas previous interleaved mathematics studies required students to learn nearly identical kinds of problems. We conclude that interleaving improves mathematics learning not only by improving discrimination between different kinds of problems but also by strengthening the association between each kind of problem and its corresponding strategy.","The Benefit of Interleaved Mathematics Practice Is Not Limited to

The First Step to Success program targets at-risk kindergartners who show the early signs of an antisocial pattern of behavior (e.g., aggression, oppositional-defiant behavior, severe tantrumming, victimization of others). First Step to Success consists of three interconnected modules: (a) proactive, universal screening of all kindergartners; (b) school intervention involving the teacher, peers, and the target child; and (c) parent/caregiver training and involvement to support the child's school adjustment. The major goal of the program is to divert at-risk kindergartners from an antisocial path in their subsequent school careers. Two cohorts of at-risk kindergartners, consisting of 24 and 22 students, were identified and exposed to the First Step to Success program during the 1993–1994 and 1994–1995 school years, respectively. A randomized, experimental, wait-list control-group design was used to evaluate intervention effects. Cohort 1 and 2 subjects were followed up through Grades 2 and 1, respectively, with differing teachers and peer groups.

level math courses were randomly assigned to receive SRL instruction or conventional instruction
(control) in their respective courses. SRL instruction was hypothesized to improve students’
math achievement by showing them how to self-reflect (i.e., self-assess and adapt to academic
quiz outcomes) more effectively. The results indicated that students receiving self-reflection
training outperformed students in the control group on instructor-developed examinations and were
better calibrated in their task-specific self-efficacy beliefs before solving problems and in their selfevaluative
judgments after solving problems. Self-reflection training also increased students’ passrate
on a national gateway examination in mathematics by 25% in comparison to that of control
students.","Enhancing self-reflection and mathematics
