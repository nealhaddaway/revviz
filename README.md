# revviz: Produce Interactive Linked Visualisations/Tables For Evidence Reviews

A work in progress. This package will provide a suite of data and table visualisation and analysis tools to support communication of the process/methods and findings of evidence reviews (including systematic reviews, systematic maps, scoping reviews, evidence and gap maps, etc.).

***November 2020***

The first function developed for this package is `dataframe2html()`, which takes a dataframe object and ouputs an attractive, full HTML file with search/filter functionality and a row count summary. Search within or filter the table by appending '?s=[query]' to your URL, for exact-phrase searches.
